## Explanation for `./tsconfig.json`
Alright, let's break down this `tsconfig.json` file. Think of it as the rulebook for how your TypeScript code should behave. 

This file is super simple. It's basically saying, "Hey, I want to use the same rules as the `tsconfig.json` file in the `.nuxt` folder."  

**Why is this important?**  Nuxt.js (a framework for building websites) uses TypeScript, and it has its own set of rules for how TypeScript should be used. This `tsconfig.json` file ensures that your project's TypeScript code follows those Nuxt.js rules. 

So, in a nutshell, this file is just a shortcut to make sure your code plays nicely with Nuxt.js! 


## Explanation for `./eslint.config.js`
Okay, let's break down this code file! It's basically the "rulebook" for how your code should be written in a Nuxt.js project.

**Think of it like a grammar checker for your code.**

* **`createConfigForNuxt`:** This is a handy function from Nuxt.js that helps you set up your ESLint rules. It's like a pre-made template for your code style.
* **`rules`:** This section is where you customize the rules. It's like saying, "I'm okay with using `console.log` (even though it's generally considered bad practice)" or "I don't mind having multi-word component names."
* **`extends`:** This section tells ESLint to use some pre-defined rule sets. Think of it like borrowing a friend's style guide.
* **`files`:** This tells ESLint which files to check.  It's like saying, "Only check my TypeScript, Vue, and JavaScript files."
* **`ignores`:** This section tells ESLint to ignore specific files or folders.  It's like saying, "Don't bother checking these files, they're already good."

**In short, this file makes sure your code follows a consistent style and catches potential errors before you even run your project.** It's like having a helpful editor who points out typos and grammatical mistakes before you submit your paper! 


## Explanation for `./drizzle.config.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a detective solving a mystery! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This file, `drizzle.config.ts`, is the **control center** for your database setup. It's like a blueprint telling Drizzle, a tool for managing your database, exactly how to connect and interact with your PostgreSQL database.

Here's the breakdown:

* **`import 'dotenv/config';`**: This line imports a library called `dotenv` which loads your environment variables from a `.env` file. Think of it as a secret vault where you store sensitive information like database passwords.
* **`import { defineConfig } from 'drizzle-kit';`**: This line imports a function called `defineConfig` from the `drizzle-kit` library. This function is the key to configuring Drizzle.
* **`export default defineConfig(...)`**: This line exports a configuration object using the `defineConfig` function. This object tells Drizzle all the important details about your database.
* **`dialect: 'postgresql'`**: This tells Drizzle you're using PostgreSQL, a popular database system.
* **`out: './server/database'`**: This specifies where Drizzle should generate the database schema files. In this case, it's in the `server/database` folder.
* **`schema: './server/database/*.ts'`**: This tells Drizzle to look for database schema files (`.ts` files) in the `server/database` folder.
* **`dbCredentials`**: This section contains all the credentials needed to connect to your database:
    * `host`: The server hosting your database (usually `localhost` for local development).
    * `port`: The port number your database listens on (usually `5432`).
    * `database`: The name of your database.
    * `user`: The username to access the database.
    * `password`: The password to access the database.
* **`verbose: false`**: This tells Drizzle to be quiet and not print too much information to the console.
* **`ssl: false`**: This tells Drizzle not to use SSL encryption when connecting to the database.
* **`strict: true`**: This tells Drizzle to be strict and throw errors if there are any inconsistencies in your database schema.

So, in short, this code file sets up Drizzle to connect to your PostgreSQL database, generate database schema files, and ensure your database is configured correctly! 

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any specific part of the code! 


## Explanation for `./vitest.config.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a pro!

This file, `vitest.config.ts`, is the heart of your testing setup using Vitest, a super-fast testing framework for JavaScript. It's like the control panel for your testing environment.

The code is super simple:

1. **`import { defineVitestConfig } from '@nuxt/test-utils/config'`:** This line imports a special function called `defineVitestConfig` from a Nuxt library. Think of it as a magic wand that lets you customize your Vitest setup.

2. **`export default defineVitestConfig({ ... })`:** This line creates a default Vitest configuration object using the `defineVitestConfig` function. The curly braces `{}` are where you'd add any specific settings you want for your tests.

**In a nutshell, this file tells Vitest how to run your tests. It's like a blueprint for your testing environment.**

Now, here's the fun part: You can add all sorts of cool things inside the curly braces to fine-tune your testing experience. For example, you can:

* **Set up test environments:**  Tell Vitest to run tests in different browsers or environments.
* **Configure test coverage:**  See how much of your code is covered by tests.
* **Define custom reporters:**  Make your test results look fancy and informative.

So, this file is like the foundation of your testing world. It's where you tell Vitest how to play the game! 


## Explanation for `./compare_document_types.py`
Alright, let's break down this Python code like it's a puzzle! 

This code is all about comparing PDF and HTML documents to find differences. Think of it as a detective looking for discrepancies between two versions of the same document. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Import the Tools:** The code starts by importing libraries like `fitz` (for PDF processing), `BeautifulSoup` (for HTML parsing), `difflib` (for text comparison), `hashlib` (for image hashing), `PIL` (for image manipulation), and `re` (for regular expressions).

2. **Extract Content:**
   - `extract_pdf_content`: This function opens a PDF file, extracts all the text from each page, and grabs any images embedded within it.
   - `extract_html_content`: This function opens an HTML file, extracts the text, and finds all image URLs.

3. **Normalize Text:** The `normalize_text` function cleans up the text by removing extra spaces, converting everything to lowercase, and stripping out punctuation. This makes the text comparison more reliable.

4. **Compare Text:** The `compare_text` function compares the main content of the PDF and HTML documents. It identifies the longest sentence in each document (assuming that's the main content) and checks if they are identical.

5. **Compare Images:** The `compare_images` function compares the images in the PDF and HTML. It calculates the hash of each image (like a unique fingerprint) and checks if there are any images missing in either document.

6. **Analyze Differences:** The `analyze_differences` function puts it all together. It calls the functions to extract content, compare text, and compare images, and then returns a dictionary summarizing the differences.

7. **The Main Event:** The code then iterates through a directory structure containing PDF and HTML files. For each pair of files, it calls `analyze_differences` to find the differences and prints a report.

8. **Statistics:** Finally, the code calculates some overall statistics, like the total number of files analyzed, the number of files with text differences, and the number of files with missing images.

**In essence, this code helps you identify discrepancies between PDF and HTML versions of documents, making sure they are consistent and accurate.** It's like a quality control check for your documents! 


## Explanation for `./document_parser.py`
Alright, let's break down this Python code. It's basically a document processing pipeline that takes HTML files, cleans them up, and then sends them to a FastAPI service for analysis. Think of it like this:

**1. Setting the Stage:**

* **Imports:** We import essential libraries like `os` for file system interaction, `re` for regular expressions (to clean up text), `json` for working with JSON data, `asyncio` for asynchronous programming, `aiohttp` for making HTTP requests, `psycopg2` for interacting with a PostgreSQL database, `datetime` for working with dates and times, and `dotenv` for loading environment variables.
* **Database Connection:** The `get_db_connection` function sets up a connection to your PostgreSQL database using environment variables. This is how the code interacts with your data storage.

**2. Cleaning Up the Mess:**

* **`extract_main_content`:** This function is the heart of the text cleaning process. It takes raw HTML content and does the following:
    * **Splits into Lines:** It breaks the content into individual lines.
    * **Removes Fluff:** It iterates through each line and removes:
        * Empty lines.
        * Lines that are just page numbers or single letters.
        * Lines that match predefined patterns (like headers, footers, or common text elements).
        * Lines that are all uppercase and short (likely titles).
    * **Joins Back Together:** Finally, it joins the cleaned lines back into a single string.

**3. Processing the Documents:**

* **`process_document`:** This function is where the magic happens. It takes a file path and a database connection as input.
    * **File ID:** It extracts the file ID from the file name.
    * **Database Check:** It checks if the document has already been processed by querying the database.
    * **Read and Clean:** It reads the HTML file, cleans the content using `extract_main_content`, and splits it into chunks (for simplicity, we're assuming only one chunk here).
    * **FastAPI Call:** For each chunk, it sends a POST request to a FastAPI service (running on `http://localhost:8000/process_document`) with the cleaned content and file ID. The FastAPI service is expected to process the document and generate an embedding (a numerical representation of the text).
    * **Store Results:** If the FastAPI service returns a success response, it stores the embedding, the cleaned content, the timestamp, and other relevant information in the database.

**4. Running the Pipeline:**

* **`process_documents`:** This function orchestrates the whole process. It takes a directory path as input.
    * **Iterate through Files:** It walks through the directory, looking for HTML files.
    * **Create Tasks:** For each HTML file, it creates an asynchronous task that calls `process_document`.
    * **Run Tasks:** It uses `asyncio.gather` to run all the tasks concurrently, speeding up the processing.

**5. Putting it All Together:**

* **`if __name__ == "__main__":`:** This block runs the code when you execute the script. It sets the directory to process and then calls `asyncio.run` to start the asynchronous processing.

**In a nutshell, this code takes HTML files, cleans them up, sends them to a FastAPI service for analysis, and stores the results in a PostgreSQL database.** It's a common workflow for document processing and analysis, and this code provides a solid foundation for building more complex pipelines.


## Explanation for `./middleware/redirects.global.ts`
Alright, so this code snippet is like a traffic cop for your website. It's called a "middleware," which means it checks every page request before it reaches the destination. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **The "elections" list:** This is a list of old election data paths, like `/data/folketingsvalg-2019/`. 
2. **The "defineNuxtRouteMiddleware" function:** This is the magic that makes the middleware work. It takes a function that checks the current page request (`to`).
3. **The "if" statement:** This checks if the current page request is in the "elections" list. If it is, it means someone is trying to access old election data.
4. **The "navigateTo" function:** This is where the redirect happens. It sends the user to a new page, `/folketingsvalg-2022-valgtest`, and tells the browser to use a "301 Moved Permanently" status code.

**In simpler terms:** This code makes sure that anyone trying to access old election data gets automatically redirected to the latest election data page. It's like a helpful sign that says, "Hey, you're looking for old stuff! We've got the latest here!" 


## Explanation for `./types/actors.ts`
Okay, so this code file is like a blueprint for different types of actors in a system. Imagine a political system with committees, politicians, and ministries. This file defines how each of these actors should look in the code.

* **`BaseActor`:** This is the basic template for all actors. It says every actor needs an ID, a name, and a type. Think of it as the common ground for everyone.
* **`Committee`, `Politician`, `Ministry`:** These are specific types of actors, each with its own unique properties. They all inherit from `BaseActor`, meaning they also have the ID, name, and type. But they also have their own special "type" property to tell them apart:
    * `Committee`:  `type: 'Udvalg'` (Danish for "Committee")
    * `Politician`: `type: 'Person'`
    * `Ministry`: `type: 'Ministerium'` (Danish for "Ministry")
* **`Actor`:** This is a way to group all the possible actor types together. It's like saying, "An actor can be either a `Committee`, a `Politician`, or a `Ministry`."

So, this file is basically setting up the structure for different types of actors in a system, making sure they all have the right information and can be easily identified. 


## Explanation for `./types/meeting.ts`
Okay, let's break down this code file! It's like a blueprint for how we represent meetings in our system. 

* **`drizzle-orm`:** This is a library we use to interact with our database. It's like a translator between our code and the database language.
* **`schema`:** This refers to the structure of our database tables.  It's like a map that tells us what columns are in each table.
* **`InferSelectModel`:** This is a fancy function from `drizzle-orm` that helps us define the types of data we can get from our database. 

So, here's what each line does:

1. **`export type Meeting = InferSelectModel<typeof schema.m√∏de>`:** This line says, "Hey, we're creating a type called `Meeting`. It represents the data we get when we select information from the `m√∏de` table in our database."  Think of `m√∏de` as the table where we store all the meeting details.
2. **`export type MeetingType = InferSelectModel<typeof schema.m√∏detype>`:** This is similar to the previous line, but it's for the `m√∏detype` table. This table likely stores information about different types of meetings (e.g., "team meeting", "project kickoff").
3. **`export type MeetingAkt√∏r = InferSelectModel<typeof schema.m√∏deAkt√∏r>`:**  This line defines the type for the `m√∏deAkt√∏r` table, which probably stores information about the people involved in a meeting (like attendees or organizers).

In short, this code file creates types that help us work with meeting data in our system. It ensures that we're using the correct data types and that our code is consistent with the database structure. 


## Explanation for `./types/akt√∏r.ts`
Okay, let's break down this code file! It's basically setting up some "blueprints" for working with data in a database. 

Think of it like this: imagine you're building a house. You need blueprints to know what each room should look like, right? This code file is like the blueprints for different types of data in your database.

* **`InferSelectModel`:** This is a fancy function from a library called `drizzle-orm`. It's like a magic wand that takes a database table definition and creates a type for you. This type tells your code exactly what kind of data you can expect from that table.
* **`schema.akt√∏r`:** This is the name of a table in your database. It might be a table that stores information about people, for example.
* **`Akt√∏r`:** This is the type created by `InferSelectModel` for the `akt√∏r` table. So, if you have a piece of data from the `akt√∏r` table, it will match the `Akt√∏r` type.
* **`Akt√∏rType`, `Akt√∏rAkt√∏rRolle`, `Akt√∏rAkt√∏r`:** These are similar types for other tables in your database, likely related to the `akt√∏r` table.

In short, this code file is defining types for different data structures in your database, making it easier for your code to work with that data in a safe and predictable way. 


## Explanation for `./types/sag.ts`
Alright, let's break down this TypeScript file! It's like a blueprint for how data about "sags" (which I'm guessing are cases or files) is structured and accessed in your application.

**The Basics:**

* **Imports:** The file starts by importing some tools from `drizzle-orm` and your database schema. Think of it as getting the building blocks for defining data types.
* **Base Types:** It then defines basic types like `Sag`, `Sagstrin`, `Dagsordenspunkt`, etc. These correspond to tables in your database, like "cases", "case stages", "agenda items", and so on.
* **Extended Types:** The real magic happens with the `WithRelations` types. These are like enhanced versions of the base types, adding information about how they connect to other tables. For example, `SagstrinWithRelations` not only has the basic `Sagstrin` data but also includes related `dagsordenspunkt` (agenda items) and `sagstrinAkt√∏r` (case stage actors) information. 

**The Big Picture:**

* **`SagWithRelations`:** This is the star of the show. It's a comprehensive type that includes all the information about a "sag" (case), including related case stages, documents, actors, and more.
* **`SagApiResponse`:** This type defines how data about a "sag" is sent back from your server. It can either contain the `SagWithRelations` data or an error message.
* **`SagDetails`:** This type seems to be used for displaying detailed information about a "sag", including the "sag" itself, related actors, documents, and speech segments.

**In a Nutshell:**

This file essentially defines how data about "sags" is structured and accessed in your application. It uses TypeScript's type system to ensure that data is consistent and predictable. Think of it as a blueprint for how your application interacts with your database. 


## Explanation for `./composables/api.ts`
Okay, so this code file is like a little recipe book for a website. It's defining how different sections of the website should be organized. 

Think of it like this:

* **`feedsInfo`** is a fancy way of saying "Here's how we want to display our news feeds." It's a dictionary (or object, in code speak) that tells us the name of each feed, its title, and how many pages of content it should have.
* **`lovforslag`** is a feed for "Lovforslag" (which I'm guessing is Danish for "Bills"). It has 10 pages of content.
* **`sag`** is a feed for "Sag" (maybe something like "Cases" or "Matters"). It has 100 pages of content.
* **`afstemning`** is a feed for "Afstemning" (likely "Voting"). It has 10 pages of content.

Then, **`validFeeds`** is a list that just pulls out the names of all the feeds from the `feedsInfo` dictionary. This is probably used later on to make sure the website only displays valid feeds.

So, this code file is basically setting up the structure for how the news feeds on the website should be organized and displayed. 


## Explanation for `./composables/useCurrentPeriode.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code like a boss! 

This code file, `useCurrentPeriode.ts`, is like a handy toolbox for managing "periodes" (think of them as time periods or intervals).  It's designed to work with a library called Pinia, which is like a fancy storage system for your app's data. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Import Stuff:**  The code first imports some tools from other files:
   - `useMetaStore`: This grabs a special store called "metaStore" which holds information about the "periodes".
   - `storeToRefs`: This is like a magic wand that lets us easily access and update data in the "metaStore".

2. **The `useCurrentPeriode` Function:** This is the main function in the file. It's like a little factory that creates a bunch of useful tools for working with "periodes".

3. **Get the Store:**  The function starts by grabbing the "metaStore" and getting access to two important pieces of data:
   - `perioder`: An array that holds all the available "periodes".
   - `currentPeriode`: The currently selected "periode".

4. **Fetch Periodes (if needed):** The `fetchPerioder` function is like a data hunter. If there are no "periodes" in the `perioder` array, it goes to the server and fetches them from the `/api/perioder` endpoint. Once it gets the data, it stores it in the `metaStore` and sets the `currentPeriode` to the first "periode" in the list.

5. **Set Current Periode:** The `setCurrentPeriode` function lets you choose which "periode" is currently active. It takes a `periodeId` as input. If the `periodeId` is null, it clears the current "periode". Otherwise, it finds the corresponding "periode" in the `perioder` array and sets it as the `currentPeriode`.

6. **Return the Tools:** Finally, the function returns a bunch of tools you can use in your app:
   - `perioder`: The array of all "periodes".
   - `currentPeriode`: The currently selected "periode".
   - `fetchPerioder`: The function to fetch "periodes" from the server.
   - `setCurrentPeriode`: The function to change the current "periode".

So, in a nutshell, this code file provides a convenient way to manage "periodes" in your app, making it easy to fetch, store, and switch between them. 


## Explanation for `./composables/useSagDocuments.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a pro! 

This file, `useSagDocuments.ts`, is like a handy toolbox for working with documents related to something called a "SAG" (probably a project or a thing). Imagine it as a little helper that fetches, stores, and manages all the documents for a specific SAG. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **The `Document` Interface:** This defines the structure of a single document. It has things like an ID, title, content, error messages, URLs, and the format of the document. Think of it as a blueprint for each document.

2. **`useSagDocuments` Function:** This is the main function. It takes a `sagId` (the ID of the SAG we're interested in) and does the following:
   - **Creates References:** It sets up some "references" using `ref` from Vue. These references are like little containers holding data:
     - `documents`: An array to hold all the documents.
     - `isLoading`: A flag to indicate if data is being fetched.
     - `error`: A container for any error messages.
   - **`fetchDocuments` Function:** This is the heart of the code. It's responsible for fetching the documents from the server:
     - It sets `isLoading` to `true` to show that we're fetching.
     - It makes a request to the `/api/sag/documents` endpoint, passing the `sagId` as a parameter.
     - If successful, it updates the `documents` reference with the fetched data.
     - If there's an error, it sets the `error` reference with a message.
     - Finally, it sets `isLoading` to `false` to signal that the fetching is done.
   - **Returns Data:** The function returns an object containing the `documents`, `isLoading`, `error`, and the `fetchDocuments` function itself. This allows other parts of your application to access and use this data and functionality.

**In essence, this file provides a way to fetch, manage, and display documents associated with a specific SAG. It's like a little document manager for your application!** 


## Explanation for `./composables/useAktorer.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code like a pro!

This code file, `useAktorer.ts`, is a Vue composable that fetches and manages a list of "actors" (think of them like characters in a story). It's designed to be used in your Vue components to easily access and display this actor data.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Imports:**
   - `useQuery` from `@tanstack/vue-query`: This is a powerful tool for fetching and caching data. It's like a superhero for making your data requests smoother and faster!
   - `useAkt√∏rStore` from `~/stores/akt√∏r`: This imports a Pinia store, which is like a central hub for managing your app's data. 
   - `Actor`: This is a type definition for an actor, likely defining the properties like name, role, etc.

2. **Akt√∏rQueryParams:**
   - This defines a type for the parameters you can use to filter your actors. Think of it like a search form where you can specify things like case ID, period, actor type, role, or even a search term.

3. **useAktorer Function:**
   - This is the main function that does the heavy lifting. It takes the `params` object as input, which contains the filters you want to apply.
   - `getAkt√∏rer`: This function builds the URL for your API request, adding the filter parameters. It then uses `$fetch` to make the request to `/api/actors` and retrieves the list of actors.
   - `useQuery`: This is where the magic happens! It uses `vue-query` to fetch the actors based on the provided parameters. It handles caching, refreshing, and error handling for you.
   - `watch`: This watches for changes in the data fetched by `useQuery` and updates the Pinia store (`akt√∏rStore`) with the new actor data.

4. **Return Values:**
   - `akt√∏rer`: This is a computed property that returns the fetched actors. It's like a live view of your actors, always updated with the latest data.
   - `isLoading`: A boolean value indicating whether the data is still being fetched.
   - `error`: Any error that occurred during the fetch process.
   - `refetch`: A function to manually refresh the data.

**In essence, this composable provides a simple and efficient way to fetch, manage, and display a list of actors in your Vue app. It uses powerful tools like `vue-query` and Pinia to make your data handling a breeze!** 


## Explanation for `./llm_service/main.py`
Alright, let's break down this Python code file, `main.py`, which is the heart of a FastAPI-based service for processing Danish text using a large language model (LLM).

**The Big Picture:**

This code sets up a web service that can handle three main tasks:

1. **Document Embedding:**  It takes a chunk of Danish text, splits it into smaller pieces (chunks), and generates a numerical representation (embedding) for each chunk using a Danish BERT model. This is useful for tasks like document similarity search.
2. **Text Embedding:** It takes a single piece of Danish text and generates a single embedding for it, also using the Danish BERT model.
3. **Question Generation:** It takes a piece of Danish text and uses a powerful LLM (Ministral-8B) to generate a relevant question based on the text.

**Key Components:**

* **FastAPI:** This is a Python framework for building web APIs. It makes it easy to define endpoints (URLs) for different functionalities.
* **Pydantic:** This library helps define data models (like `DocumentRequest`, `DocumentResponse`, etc.) to ensure the data sent to and from the API is structured correctly.
* **Transformers:** This library provides pre-trained language models like BERT, making it easy to use them for tasks like embedding generation.
* **Torch:** The PyTorch library is used for handling the numerical computations involved in embedding generation.
* **uvicorn:** This is a fast ASGI server that runs the FastAPI application.
* **mlx_lm:** This library is used to load and interact with the Ministral-8B LLM.

**Code Breakdown:**

1. **Imports:**  The code imports necessary libraries for web development, data handling, language modeling, and more.
2. **Danish Stopwords:** The code defines a set of common Danish words (stopwords) that are often irrelevant for tasks like embedding generation.
3. **Model Loading:**  The Danish BERT model (`Maltehb/danish-bert-botxo`) is loaded from Hugging Face's model hub.
4. **Text Preprocessing:** The `preprocess_danish_text` function prepares text for processing by converting it to lowercase and removing extra whitespace.
5. **Text Chunking:** The `split_text_into_chunks` function splits a long text into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
6. **LLM Loading:** The Ministral-8B LLM is loaded for question generation.
7. **Data Models:** The `DocumentRequest`, `DocumentResponse`, `TextEmbeddingRequest`, `TextEmbeddingResponse`, and `QuestionRequest` classes define the expected input and output structures for the API endpoints.
8. **API Endpoints:** The code defines three API endpoints:
    * `/process_document_embeddings`:  Takes a document, splits it into chunks, and generates embeddings for each chunk.
    * `/get_embedding`:  Takes a piece of text and generates an embedding.
    * `/generate_question`:  Takes a piece of text and generates a question.
9. **Health Check:** The `/health` endpoint is a simple way to check if the service is running.
10. **CORS Middleware:** This allows requests from different origins (like a web browser running on a different port) to access the API.
11. **Running the Server:** The code starts the uvicorn server to run the FastAPI application.

**In a Nutshell:**

This code file creates a web service that uses a Danish BERT model and a powerful LLM to process Danish text, providing functionalities like document embedding and question generation. It's a great example of how to build a practical NLP service using modern tools. 


## Explanation for `./config/xml_comparer.py`
Alright, let's break down this code file. Imagine you have a bunch of XML files representing meeting data, and you want to compare them. This code does just that, but with a twist! It not only compares the structure of the XML files but also uses a separate "metadata" file to understand what each element means.

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Extracting the Structure:** The `extract_structure` function takes an XML file and builds a dictionary. The keys are paths within the XML (like `/meeting/attendees/person`) and the values are lists of attributes for each element at that path. This gives you a blueprint of the XML's organization.

2. **Comparing Structures:** The `compare_structures` function takes a list of these structure dictionaries and creates a new dictionary. The keys are the paths, and the values are lists of attributes from each file. This lets you see which elements are present or missing in each file.

3. **Metadata Magic:** The `extract_metadata_structure` function reads the "metadata.xml" file. This file defines the meaning of each element in your meeting data. For example, it might tell you that "person" has "name" and "email" properties.

4. **Mapping to Metadata:** The `map_to_metadata` function takes the XML structure and metadata and combines them. It creates a dictionary where the keys are entity names (like "person") and the values are dictionaries containing both the attributes from the XML and the metadata information.

5. **The Grand Comparison:** The `compare_mapped_structures` function takes a list of these mapped structures and compares them. It creates a dictionary where the keys are entity names, and the values are lists of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents the data from one file, including both the attributes and the metadata.

6. **Saving the Results:** Finally, the code writes the comparison results to a file called "comparison_result.txt". This file shows you which entities are present or missing in each file, along with their attributes and metadata.

**In essence, this code helps you analyze your meeting data by comparing the structure of your XML files and enriching the comparison with metadata information. It's like having a super-powered magnifying glass for your data!** 


## Explanation for `./config/rename_postgres.py`
Alright, let's break down this Python code file. It's basically a table and column name fixer for your PostgreSQL database! 

Imagine you have some tables and columns with special characters like "√¶", "√∏", or "√•". This script goes through your database, finds those characters, and replaces them with more standard ones like "ae", "oe", and "aa". 

Here's how it works:

1. **Connect to the database:**  The code establishes a connection to your PostgreSQL database using the `psycopg2` library. It's like opening the door to your database.
2. **Define replacements:**  The `char_map` dictionary tells the script which characters to replace and with what. It's like a cheat sheet for the name changes.
3. **Find tables:**  The script fetches all the table names from your database. It's like getting a list of all the rooms in your database house.
4. **Rename tables:**  For each table, the script checks if it has any special characters. If it does, it replaces them and renames the table. It's like changing the room names to be more user-friendly.
5. **Find columns:**  For each table, the script finds all the column names. It's like getting a list of all the items in each room.
6. **Rename columns:**  For each column, the script checks if it has any special characters. If it does, it replaces them and renames the column. It's like changing the names of the items in each room.
7. **Commit changes:**  After all the renaming is done, the script saves the changes to your database. It's like making the new room and item names permanent.

So, in essence, this script is like a database janitor, cleaning up table and column names to make them more consistent and easier to work with. It's a handy tool for keeping your database organized! 


## Explanation for `./config/download_oda_bak.py`
Alright, let's break down this Python code like a boss!

This script is basically a file downloader. It grabs a file named "oda.bak" from a specific website (the URL) and saves it locally. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Imports:** It starts by importing the `requests` library, which is a super handy tool for making web requests. 
2. **Credentials:**  It defines the URL of the website, the username, and the password needed to access the file. 
3. **Download:** The `requests.get` function fetches the file from the website using the provided credentials.
4. **Save:** Finally, it opens a local file named "oda.bak" in write-binary mode (`"wb"`) and writes the downloaded content into it.

So, in essence, this script is like a digital postman, fetching a package from a website and delivering it to your computer! 


## Explanation for `./config/parse_meetings.py`
Alright, let's break down this Python code! It's basically a meeting parser, taking XML files representing meeting transcripts and transforming them into a structured format. Think of it like a translator from XML-speak to Python-speak.

**The Big Picture**

The code does three main things:

1. **Parses individual meeting XML files:** It takes an XML file, reads the meeting data (like the date, agenda items, and speeches), and converts it into a Python dictionary.
2. **Extracts speaker information:** It digs into the XML to find details about each speaker, like their name, role, and the content of their speech.
3. **Combines all meetings into a single dictionary:** It iterates through all XML files in a specified directory, parsing each one and storing the results in a single dictionary.

**Key Functions**

* `parse_speaker_data(metadata)`: This function takes the metadata about a speaker from the XML and extracts information like their name, role, and any relevant IDs.
* `parse_meeting_xml(file_path)`: This is the heart of the parser. It reads an XML file, extracts meeting metadata (date, number, etc.), and then iterates through each agenda item, extracting the text and speaker information for each speech.
* `parse_all_meetings()`: This function finds all XML files in a specified directory, calls `parse_meeting_xml` on each one, and stores the results in a dictionary.

**Example**

Imagine you have an XML file like this:

```xml
<Meeting>
  <MetaMeeting>
    <DateOfSitting>2023-01-01</DateOfSitting>
    <MeetingNumber>1</MeetingNumber>
  </MetaMeeting>
  <DagsordenPunkt>
    <MetaFTAgendaItem>
      <ItemNo>1</ItemNo>
      <ShortTitle>Budget Debate</ShortTitle>
    </MetaFTAgendaItem>
    <Tale>
      <MetaSpeakerMP>
        <OratorFirstName>John</OratorFirstName>
        <OratorLastName>Doe</OratorLastName>
      </MetaSpeakerMP>
      <TaleSegment>
        <Char>This is a speech about the budget.</Char>
      </TaleSegment>
    </Tale>
  </DagsordenPunkt>
</Meeting>
```

This code would extract the following information:

* Meeting date: 2023-01-01
* Meeting number: 1
* Agenda item: Budget Debate
* Speaker: John Doe
* Speech content: "This is a speech about the budget."

**In a Nutshell**

This code is a powerful tool for analyzing meeting transcripts. It takes complex XML data and makes it easy to access and work with in Python.  It's like having a super-efficient librarian who organizes all your meeting transcripts into neat, searchable folders! 


## Explanation for `./config/analyse_meeting_xml.py`
Alright, let's break down this Python code! It's basically a detective for XML files, trying to understand their structure and the data they hold. Think of it as a data explorer, but for XML files.

**The Code's Mission**

The code's main goal is to analyze an XML file (like a meeting transcript) and give you a report on its structure and data. It does this in two steps:

1. **Structure Analysis:** It dives into the XML file, like a tree climber, going through each tag and its attributes. It then prints a nicely formatted tree-like representation of the XML structure, showing you how all the elements are nested.

2. **Data Analysis:** It extracts the data from the XML file, focusing on text content and attributes. It then counts the unique values for each data point and even gives you a few sample values.

**The Code's Tools**

* **`ET.parse(xml_file_path)`:** This line uses the `xml.etree.ElementTree` library to open and read your XML file. It's like opening a book and getting ready to read!
* **`print_structure(element, depth=0)`:** This function is the tree climber. It takes an XML element and recursively explores its children, printing the tag names and attributes at each level, creating a visual representation of the XML's structure.
* **`analyze_data(element, path="")`:** This function is the data extractor. It walks through the XML tree, collecting text content and attributes, counting unique values, and storing them in a dictionary.

**The Code's Output**

The code is designed to write its findings to a file named "meeting_minutes_analysis.txt". This file would contain:

* **XML Structure:** A nicely formatted tree representation of the XML file.
* **Data Analysis:** A list of data points, their unique values, and some sample values.
* **Possible Connections to Prisma Schema:** (This part is commented out, but it's interesting!) It tries to map the XML paths to fields in a Prisma schema, suggesting how you might connect the data from the XML file to a database.

**In a Nutshell**

This code is like a data detective for XML files. It analyzes the structure, extracts the data, and gives you a report on what it finds. It's a handy tool for understanding and working with XML data! 


## Explanation for `./plugins/vue-query.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code like a pro! This file is all about making sure your Vue app uses **Vue Query** efficiently, especially when you're dealing with server-side rendering (SSR).

**Here's the gist:**

1. **Setting up Vue Query:** The code creates a `QueryClient` which is like the boss of all your data fetching operations. It sets some default settings like how often to refresh data (5 minutes) and whether to automatically update when the user focuses the window.

2. **Nuxt Integration:** This code uses Nuxt's `defineNuxtPlugin` to integrate Vue Query into your Nuxt app. It essentially tells Nuxt to use Vue Query and pass the `QueryClient` as the configuration.

3. **SSR Magic:** Here's where things get interesting. The code checks if it's running on the server (using `import.meta.server`). If it is, it saves the current state of the `QueryClient` (using `dehydrate`) into a special Nuxt state variable called `vue-query`.  

4. **Client-Side Hydration:** On the client-side (using `import.meta.client`), the code uses the saved state from `vue-query` to rehydrate (using `hydrate`) the `QueryClient`. This means the client-side app starts with all the data already fetched on the server, making your app super fast!

**In a nutshell, this code is like a data-fetching superhero, ensuring your Vue app is lightning-fast and efficient, especially when you're using server-side rendering.** 


## Explanation for `./plugins/init.server.ts`
Okay, let's break down this code snippet like a pro! 

This file, `init.server.ts`, is like the welcome mat for your Nuxt.js server. It's a special file that gets executed when your Nuxt app starts up on the server side. 

The code you see is pretty simple:

* **`export default defineNuxtPlugin(() => { ... })`**:  This line tells Nuxt, "Hey, I'm a plugin! Run this code when the server starts."
* **`// console.info('init server');`**: This is a comment. It's like a note to yourself (or other developers) that says, "This is where the server initialization happens." The comment is currently commented out, so it doesn't actually do anything.

In short, this file is like the "Hello, world!" of your server-side Nuxt app. It's a placeholder for any server-side initialization logic you might need.  Think of it as a blank canvas ready for you to add your own server-side magic! 


## Explanation for `./plugins/device.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file like it's a puzzle! 

**The Big Picture:**

This code file is a Nuxt plugin, which is like a special ingredient you add to your Nuxt application to give it extra powers. In this case, it's designed to help you figure out if a user is browsing on a mobile device. 

**The Code Breakdown:**

1. **`REGEX_MOBILE1` and `REGEX_MOBILE2`:** These are like secret codes that look for specific patterns in a user's browser's "user agent" string. This string tells the website what kind of device the user is using. The regexes are designed to detect common mobile device names and keywords.

2. **`isMobile` Function:** This function takes the user agent string and checks if it matches either of the secret codes (regexes). If it does, it means the user is likely on a mobile device, and the function returns `true`.

3. **`userAgent` Variable:** This variable tries to grab the user agent string from the browser's request headers. If it can't find it there, it tries to get it from the `navigator` object, which is a built-in browser feature.

4. **`defineNuxtPlugin`:** This is the magic function that tells Nuxt to use this code as a plugin. It takes a function that does something, and in this case, that something is to make the `isMobile` function available to your entire Nuxt application.

**In a Nutshell:**

This plugin is a handy way to check if a user is on a mobile device. You can use the `isMobile` function in your Nuxt components to show different content or styles depending on the device. For example, you might want to display a simplified version of your website on mobile devices.

**Think of it like this:**

Imagine you're a waiter at a restaurant. You need to know if someone is ordering for a large group or just for themselves. This plugin is like a special device that helps you figure out the size of the group by looking at their clothes and how they're talking. 


## Explanation for `./.output/nitro.json`
Alright, so this file, `nitro.json`, is like a secret recipe for a web app built with Nitro (a super-fast framework). It's basically a blueprint telling the app how to run. 

Let's break it down:

* **`date`:** This is just a timestamp, like a time capsule marking when this recipe was last updated.
* **`preset`:** This tells Nitro to use a specific setup called "node-server". Think of it like choosing a pre-made cake mix instead of starting from scratch.
* **`commands`:** This section defines how to run different parts of the app. In this case, it has one command:
    * **`preview`:** This command tells Nitro to run the app in "preview mode", which means it starts a web server using the code in `./server/index.mjs`. This lets you see how your app looks and works before deploying it to the real world.

So, in a nutshell, this `nitro.json` file is like a shortcut for setting up a web app using Nitro. It tells the app to use a specific setup and how to run it in preview mode. Pretty neat, right? 


## Explanation for `./.output/server/package.json`
Alright, let's break down this `package.json` file. Think of it as the blueprint for your server project! It's like a shopping list for all the tools and ingredients you need to build your server app. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

* **`name`:** This is the name of your project. In this case, it's "parlamentet.dk-prod", which sounds like a production server for a website called "parlamentet.dk".
* **`version`:** This tells us the version of your project. It's currently at "0.0.1", which is a very early version.
* **`type`:** This tells us that your project uses the "module" system for importing and exporting code. It's the modern way of doing things in JavaScript.
* **`private`:** This setting tells us that this project is not meant to be shared publicly. It's likely for internal use only.
* **`dependencies`:** This is the heart of the file! It lists all the libraries and tools your server needs to run. You've got a whole bunch of them! Let's break down some of the key ones:
    * **`@prisma/client`:** This is a database toolkit that helps you interact with your database (likely a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL).
    * **`vue`:** This is the popular JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. It seems like you're using Vue to build the frontend of your server.
    * **`vue-router`:** This library helps you manage navigation within your Vue application.
    * **`winston`:** This is a logging library that helps you keep track of what's happening in your server.
    * **`@unhead/ssr`:** This is a library that helps you render your Vue application on the server, which can improve performance and SEO.

**So, in a nutshell:**

This `package.json` file describes a private server project that uses Vue to build a user interface and relies on Prisma to connect to a database. It's likely a production server for the "parlamentet.dk" website.  

Let me know if you want me to explain any of the other dependencies in more detail! 


## Explanation for `./.output/public/mockServiceWorker.js`
Alright, let's break down this `mockServiceWorker.js` file. It's like a secret agent for your web app, intercepting network requests and giving you control over how they behave. 

**The Big Picture**

This file is part of a library called MSW (Mock Service Worker). It's a tool that helps developers simulate real network requests during development, making testing and development smoother. Think of it like a stand-in for your actual backend server.

**What's Going On**

1. **Setting Up:** The code starts by defining some constants and initializing a set to keep track of active clients. It also sets up event listeners for `install`, `activate`, and `message`. These events are triggered when the service worker is installed, activated, and receives messages from the web app.

2. **Handling Messages:** The `message` event listener is crucial. It receives messages from the web app, telling the service worker things like:
    - "KEEPALIVE_REQUEST":  A ping to make sure the service worker is alive.
    - "INTEGRITY_CHECK_REQUEST":  A check to ensure the service worker is the correct version.
    - "MOCK_ACTIVATE":  The web app wants to start using the service worker for mocking.
    - "MOCK_DEACTIVATE":  The web app wants to stop using the service worker for mocking.
    - "CLIENT_CLOSED":  The web app is closing, so the service worker should unregister itself if there are no other active clients.

3. **Intercepting Requests:** The `fetch` event listener is where the magic happens. When a request is made from the web app, this listener intercepts it.
    - **Bypass Checks:**  The code first checks if the request should be bypassed (e.g., if it's a server-sent event, a navigation request, or if the service worker isn't active).
    - **Request Handling:** If the request isn't bypassed, it's sent to the web app's MSW instance. The web app's MSW instance can then decide how to respond to the request (e.g., with a mock response, an error, or by letting the request go through to the real server).
    - **Response Handling:** The service worker receives the response from the web app and sends it back to the web app.

4. **Helper Functions:** The code includes helper functions for tasks like:
    - `resolveMainClient`:  Finding the main client that registered the service worker.
    - `serializeHeaders`:  Converting headers into a format that can be sent to the web app.
    - `sendToClient`:  Sending a message to the web app.
    - `delayPromise`:  Delaying a promise.
    - `respondWithMock`:  Creating a response from a mock response object.
    - `uuidv4`:  Generating a unique ID.

**In a Nutshell**

This `mockServiceWorker.js` file is the backbone of MSW's request interception and mocking capabilities. It acts as a bridge between the web app and the mock responses defined in the web app's MSW instance. It allows developers to control network requests and create realistic simulations for a smoother development experience.


## Explanation for `./.output/public/_nuxt/folketingsvalg-2022-valgtest.22959446.js`
Okay, let's break down this code file. It's basically a JavaScript file that creates a simple quiz or "valgtest" (election test) for the Danish Parliament (Folketinget). 

Think of it like this: You're presented with a series of parliamentary proposals. You get to vote "yay" or "nay" on each one. After completing the quiz, you can see how your votes align with the voting patterns of different political parties in the Danish Parliament.

Here's a quick breakdown of what's happening:

* **Imports:** The code imports various components and functions from other files. These include functions for creating SVG icons (like the "yay" and "nay" buttons) and components for displaying the quiz questions and results.
* **Quiz Components:** There are functions like `M`, `x`, `B`, and `D` that create the SVG icons for the buttons.  
* **Question Component:** The `Question` component is responsible for displaying the quiz questions. It shows the current question, the "yay" and "nay" buttons, and a "next" button to proceed.
* **Quiz Component:** The `folketingsvalg-2022-valgtest` component is the main component. It manages the quiz flow, displays the progress bar, and handles sending the results to the server.
* **Results Component:** The code also includes a component for displaying the results, showing how your voting pattern aligns with different parties.

The code uses a framework like Vue.js or React.js to create a dynamic user interface. It fetches data from an API to get the quiz questions and party voting data. 

Essentially, this code file creates a fun and interactive way to learn about the Danish Parliament and see how your political views might align with different parties. 


## Explanation for `./.output/public/_nuxt/_plugin-vue_export-helper.c27b6911.js`
Alright, let's break down this code snippet. It's a JavaScript file, and its main purpose is to help Vue.js with its component setup. 

Think of it like a handy tool for organizing your Vue components. It's called `_plugin-vue_export-helper` because it's used to help with exporting components from Vue. 

The code defines a function called `s`. This function takes two arguments: 

1. **`t`**: This represents a Vue component.
2. **`r`**: This is an array of key-value pairs. Each pair represents a property and its value that you want to add to the component.

The function does the following:

1. It gets the component's options, which are like a set of instructions for how the component should behave.
2. It loops through the key-value pairs in `r` and adds each property to the component's options.
3. Finally, it returns the updated component options.

The `export` statement at the end makes the `s` function available for other parts of your Vue application to use. It's essentially like saying, "Hey, here's a tool you can use to add properties to your Vue components!"

So, in a nutshell, this code file provides a helper function that makes it easier to manage and extend Vue components. It's a small but important piece of the puzzle that helps keep your Vue code organized and efficient.

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Imports:** The code first imports a bunch of functions and components from another file called "entry.f8bdbc71.js". These are likely functions for building the user interface, handling data, and other essential tasks.

2. **PartyItem Component:** This component is responsible for displaying information about a single political party. It takes the party's data as a prop and calculates the party's agreement percentage based on the user's quiz answers.

3. **Quiz Data:**  The code defines a list of quiz questions (`B`) and a list of political parties (`v`). Each quiz question has information like its title, the parties that support it, and the parties that oppose it. The party data includes information like the party's initials, color, logo, and initial agreement/disagreement counts.

4. **ElectionQuiz Store:** This is a Vuex store that manages the state of the quiz. It keeps track of the current question, the user's answers, and the parties' agreement/disagreement scores. It also has actions to handle user interactions like answering questions and navigating through the quiz.

5. **Parties Component:** This is the main component that displays the quiz results. It takes the list of parties and the user's answers as props. It uses the `ElectionQuiz` store to calculate the final agreement/disagreement scores for each party and displays them in a sorted list.

**In a nutshell, this code file creates a dynamic component that presents a political quiz, tracks user responses, and then displays the results, showing how each party aligns with the user's views.** 

**Think of it like this:** You're building a website where users can take a quiz about political issues. This code file is the engine behind the quiz, handling the questions, responses, and displaying the final results. 


## Explanation for `./.output/public/_nuxt/index.be49ab28.js`

Think of it like a recipe for building the page:

1. **Imports:** It starts by bringing in some ingredients (functions) from another file called "entry.f8bdbc71.js". These functions are like tools to create the page's structure and content.

2. **Building the Page:**  The code then defines a component called "index" which is responsible for displaying the page. It uses these imported tools to:
    * **Set the title:**  "Parlamentet.dk ‚Äì ODA Test"
    * **Create a header:** It updates the header title to "ODA Test"
    * **Build the main content:** It creates a div with a class "flex" and puts some text inside. This text is about a page that might be part of an older version of the website. 

3. **Exporting the Recipe:** Finally, it exports the "index" component so that other parts of the website can use it.

In short, this file is a blueprint for creating the "index" page of the "Parlamentet.dk" website. It uses imported functions to set the page's title, update the header, and build the main content, which is a message about a potentially outdated page. 


## Explanation for `./.output/public/_nuxt/valgtest-resultat.d0ec365e.js`
Okay, let's break down what this JavaScript code file does. It's basically the heart of a webpage that shows the results of a political quiz, or "valgtest" as it's called in Danish.

**The Code's Purpose:**

This code file, `valgtest-resultat.d0ec365e.js`, is responsible for displaying the results of a political quiz. It fetches data from an API, processes it, and then renders the results in a visually appealing way.

**Key Elements:**

* **Data Fetching:** The code uses `fetch` to retrieve data from two API endpoints: `/api/election` and `/api/vote`. 
    * `/api/election` provides information about the parties, their agreement/disagreement percentages, and the total number of times the quiz has been taken.
    * `/api/vote` provides the results of the quiz, including the average agreement/disagreement percentages for each question and the "winners" (the parties with the highest average agreement).

* **Data Processing:** The code sorts the parties based on their agreement percentages, calculates the percentage of "yay" and "nay" responses for each question, and determines the winning parties.

* **Rendering:** The code uses Vue.js (a JavaScript framework) to dynamically render the results on the webpage. It creates elements like headings, paragraphs, progress bars, and a list of parties.

**In Simple Terms:**

Imagine you took a political quiz. This code file takes the data from all the people who took the quiz, analyzes it, and then presents the results in a clear and understandable way. It shows you the average agreement/disagreement percentages for each question, the parties that performed best overall, and how many people took the quiz.

**Let me know if you want to dive into any specific part of the code in more detail!** 


## Explanation for `./.output/public/_nuxt/error-500.6361e39a.js`
Alright, let's break down this code file! It's basically the blueprint for a "500 error" page you see when a website crashes. Think of it as the "oops, something went wrong" page.

3. **Main Component:** The key component is `V`, which is the main component for the webpage. It uses a function called `setup` to define how the page will look and behave. 
4. **Content:** Inside `setup`, you see the page's content being built. It includes:
    * A welcome message with a heading and paragraphs.
    * Information about the old "Parlamentet.dk" and its challenges.
    * A link to a historical "valgtest" (probably a voting simulation).
    * A call to action to contribute to the open-source project on GitHub.
5. **Meta Data:** It also sets up meta data for the page, like the title and description, which helps search engines understand the page's content.
