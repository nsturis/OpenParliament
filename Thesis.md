# Thesis Analysis

## Repository Structure
Alright, let's dive into this repository structure like a detective cracking a code! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## The Big Picture:

This project looks like a web application built with Nuxt.js (a popular framework for building Vue.js applications) on the frontend and likely FastAPI (a Python framework) on the backend. 

Here's a breakdown of the main directories and their roles:

**Frontend (Nuxt.js):**

* **pages:**  This is where your Nuxt.js routes and components live. You've got pages for lovforslag (legislation), ugeplan (weekly schedule), sager (cases), and more. 
* **components:**  Reusable UI elements like headers, buttons, and lists.
* **layouts:**  Defines the overall structure of your pages (like a header and footer).
* **public:**  Static assets like images, fonts, and favicons.
* **scripts:**  Scripts for tasks like parsing data (likely for the frontend).
* **stores:**  Vuex stores for managing application state (think of it like a central data hub for your app).
* **composables:**  Reusable logic functions for your Vue components.
* **middleware:**  Functions that run before or after a page loads (like redirects).
* **types:**  TypeScript interfaces for defining the structure of your data.
* **plugins:**  Nuxt plugins for adding functionality to your app (like Vue Query for data fetching).
* **_templates:**  Templates for generating new components, pages, and generators (likely using a tool like `plop`).

**Backend (FastAPI):**

* **server:**  This is where the backend logic lives.
    * **api:**  Handles API endpoints for interacting with the backend.
    * **database:**  Manages the database connection and schema.
    * **llm:**  Likely interacts with a large language model (LLM) for tasks like generating text or answering questions.
    * **oda:**  Seems to handle data synchronization from a source called "ODA" (perhaps an external system).
    * **repositories:**  Provides access to data through a more structured interface.
    * **parser:**  Parses data from various sources.
    * **tasks:**  Background tasks or scheduled jobs.
* **llm_service:**  A separate Python service for interacting with the LLM.
* **config:**  Configuration files for the project.
* **tests:**  Unit and end-to-end tests for both frontend and backend.
* **utils:**  Helper functions and utilities.

**Other:**

* **.vscode:**  Visual Studio Code configuration files.
* **init-scripts:**  Scripts for initializing the project (like setting up the database).
* **scripts:**  Scripts for various tasks (like parsing data).

## Patterns and Conventions:

* **TypeScript:**  The use of `tsconfig.json` and `.ts` files indicates TypeScript is used for type safety.
* **Nuxt.js:**  The `nuxt.config.ts` file and the structure of the `pages`, `components`, and `layouts` directories are typical of Nuxt.js projects.
* **FastAPI:**  The `server` directory with `api` endpoints and `database` management suggests FastAPI is used for the backend.
* **Docker:**  The `docker-compose.yaml` and `Dockerfile` files indicate Docker is used for containerizing the application.
* **Git:**  The `.git` directory suggests Git is used for version control.

## Key Components:

* **Frontend:**  The Nuxt.js application built with Vue.js, responsible for the user interface and interactions.
* **Backend:**  The FastAPI application, responsible for handling data, logic, and API requests.
* **Database:**  The PostgreSQL database, storing the application's data.
* **LLM:**  A large language model, likely used for tasks like text generation or question answering.
* **ODA:**  An external system that provides data for the application.

## Project Type:

This project seems to be a web application that likely deals with legislation, parliamentary schedules, and political data. The presence of an LLM suggests it might offer features like text summarization, question answering, or even generating reports based on the data.

**In a nutshell, this repository is a well-organized web application built with Nuxt.js and FastAPI, leveraging a database, an LLM, and external data sources to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing and analyzing political information.** 

Let me know if you want to explore any specific parts of the project in more detail! 


## Explanation for `./Thesis copy.md`
This repository is a web application built with a modern technology stack: Nuxt.js for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and Docker for containerization.  It also leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) for tasks like question generation.

Here's a breakdown of the key components:

* **Frontend:** Nuxt.js, Vue.js, TypeScript
* **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, PostgreSQL
* **LLM:** Likely a large language model like GPT-3 or similar.
* **Data:** Data from an external source (ODA) is processed and stored in the PostgreSQL database.

The project seems to be well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend, and a focus on data management and integration with external sources. 


## Explanation for `./tsconfig.json`
Alright, let's break down this `tsconfig.json` file. It's like a blueprint for your TypeScript project, telling the compiler how to handle your code.

This one's pretty simple:

* **`extends": "./.nuxt/tsconfig.json"`:** This line tells the compiler to use the settings from another file, `.nuxt/tsconfig.json`. Think of it like inheriting the rules from a parent. Nuxt.js, a framework for building web apps, uses this file to set up TypeScript for you.

So, basically, this file just says "Hey compiler, use the settings from this other file I'm pointing to." It's a shortcut to avoid repeating the same settings in multiple places. 

This way, you can focus on building your awesome web app without worrying about the nitty-gritty details of TypeScript configuration. üòé 


## Explanation for `./eslint.config.js`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a detective cracking a case!  This file, `eslint.config.js`, is like the rulebook for your code. It's using a tool called ESLint to make sure your code is written consistently and follows best practices. Think of it as a grammar checker for your code!

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **`createConfigForNuxt`:** This function is like a magic spell that sets up ESLint specifically for Nuxt.js projects (Nuxt.js is a popular framework for building websites). 

2. **`rules`:** This section is where you define your own rules.  For example, `'no-console': 'off'` tells ESLint to ignore warnings about using `console.log` (a helpful tool for debugging).  You can also turn on rules, like `'prettier/prettier': 'on'`, which makes sure your code is formatted nicely.

3. **`extends`:**  This is like borrowing rules from other rulebooks.  Here, we're using rules from `@nuxtjs/eslint-config-typescript` (for TypeScript code) and `plugin:nuxt/recommended` (for Nuxt.js best practices).

4. **`files`:**  This tells ESLint which files to check. In this case, it's looking at all files ending in `.ts`, `.tsx`, or `.vue` (these are common file types for Nuxt.js projects).

5. **`ignores`:** This is like a "do not disturb" sign.  It tells ESLint to skip certain files, like those in the `**/.*` (hidden files) and `utils/oda.ts` directories.

**In short, this file is setting up ESLint to check your code for errors and style issues, making sure your code is clean and consistent!** 


## Explanation for `./drizzle.config.ts`
Alright, let's break down this `drizzle.config.ts` file. Imagine it's like a blueprint for your database setup. 

**Here's the gist:**

1. **Imports:** We're bringing in some tools:
    * `dotenv/config`: This helps us load environment variables (like your database credentials) from a `.env` file. Think of it as a secret stash for sensitive information.
    * `defineConfig` from `drizzle-kit`: This is the magic function that lets us create our configuration.

2. **Configuration:** This is where the real magic happens. We're telling `drizzle-kit` how to connect to our database and what to do with it:
    * `dialect`: We're using PostgreSQL, a popular database system.
    * `out`: This tells `drizzle-kit` where to put the generated database files (in this case, a folder named `server/database`).
    * `schema`: This tells `drizzle-kit` where to find the definitions of your database tables (in `server/database/*.ts`).
    * `dbCredentials`: This is where we provide the connection details for our database. It's grabbing the information from environment variables, so make sure you have those set up in your `.env` file.
    * `verbose`, `ssl`, and `strict`: These are optional settings that control how `drizzle-kit` behaves.

**In a nutshell:** This file tells `drizzle-kit` everything it needs to know to connect to your PostgreSQL database, generate the necessary files, and manage your database schema. It's like a conductor leading an orchestra of database operations! 


## Explanation for `./vitest.config.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code snippet. It's like the blueprint for your testing setup in a Nuxt project! 

Think of it this way: Nuxt is your fancy house, and Vitest is the handyman who makes sure everything works smoothly. This file, `vitest.config.ts`, is the handyman's toolbox. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **`import { defineVitestConfig } from '@nuxt/test-utils/config'`:** This line brings in the special tool from Nuxt's testing library that lets you customize Vitest's behavior. It's like grabbing the right wrench from the toolbox.

2. **`export default defineVitestConfig({ ... })`:** This line says, "Here's how I want Vitest to work!" The curly braces `{}` are where you put your specific instructions.  

3. **`// any custom Vitest config you require`:** This is a comment, like a sticky note reminding you to add your own tweaks. You can tell Vitest things like:
    * **Which files to test:**  "Hey Vitest, check out these components!"
    * **How to run the tests:** "Run them fast, run them slow, run them in parallel!"
    * **What to do if a test fails:** "Let me know if something breaks!"

So, in a nutshell, this file is like a personalized instruction manual for Vitest, making sure your tests run smoothly and give you the information you need to build a rock-solid Nuxt app! 


## Explanation for `./compare_document_types.py`
Alright, let's break down this code! It's basically a detective for finding differences between PDF and HTML versions of documents. Think of it as a super-powered document comparison tool. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Import the Tools:** The code starts by importing libraries like `fitz` (for PDF handling), `BeautifulSoup` (for HTML parsing), `difflib` (for text comparison), and `hashlib` (for image comparison). It's like gathering all the detective tools!

2. **Extract Content:** The `extract_pdf_content` and `extract_html_content` functions are like our document scanners. They pull out the text and images from both PDF and HTML files.

3. **Normalize Text:** The `normalize_text` function cleans up the text by removing extra spaces, punctuation, and making everything lowercase. This makes comparing the text more accurate.

4. **Compare Text:** The `compare_text` function compares the main content of the PDF and HTML. It tries to find the longest sentence in each document and see if they match. If they don't, it highlights the differences.

5. **Compare Images:** The `compare_images` function compares the images in both documents. It calculates a unique "fingerprint" (hash) for each image and checks if they match. If an image is missing in one document, it gets flagged.

6. **Analyze Differences:** The `analyze_differences` function puts it all together. It calls the previous functions to extract content, compare text and images, and then reports the differences found.

7. **Main Program:** The code then goes through a directory of documents, comparing each PDF and HTML pair. It analyzes the differences and prints a report showing:

   * **Text Differences:** It highlights the differences in the main content using colored output (green for additions, red for deletions).
   * **Missing Images:** It lists the images that are missing in either the PDF or HTML.

8. **Overall Statistics:** Finally, it calculates the overall number of files analyzed, files with text differences, and files with missing images. This gives us a summary of the comparison results.

**In a nutshell, this code is like a document quality control inspector. It helps ensure that the PDF and HTML versions of documents are consistent and accurate.** 


## Explanation for `./document_parser.py`
Alright, let's break down this Python code. It's basically a document parser that takes HTML files, extracts their content, and stores them in a database along with their embeddings. Think of it as a way to make your documents searchable and understandable by a computer!

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Imports:** We start by importing necessary libraries:
   - `os` for file system operations
   - `re` for regular expressions (pattern matching)
   - `json` for working with JSON data
   - `asyncio` for asynchronous programming (making things faster)
   - `aiohttp` for making HTTP requests (to a FastAPI service)
   - `psycopg2` for connecting to a PostgreSQL database
   - `datetime` for working with dates and times
   - `dotenv` for loading environment variables (like database credentials)

2. **Database Connection:** The `get_db_connection` function sets up a connection to your PostgreSQL database using environment variables. 

3. **Content Cleaning:** The `extract_main_content` function is the heart of the parser. It takes raw HTML content and cleans it up by:
   - Removing empty lines and lines that are just page numbers or single letters.
   - Removing lines that match common header/footer patterns (like "Aktstk.", "Folketinget", etc.).
   - Optionally removing short, all-uppercase lines (likely titles).

4. **Document Processing:** The `process_document` function is the main workhorse:
   - It takes a file path and the database connection.
   - It checks if the document has already been processed by looking in the database.
   - It reads the HTML file and cleans the content using `extract_main_content`.
   - It sends the cleaned content to a FastAPI service (running at `http://localhost:8000/process_document`) to generate an embedding.
   - It stores the cleaned content, embedding, and other metadata in the database.

5. **Processing Multiple Documents:** The `process_documents` function takes a directory path and processes all HTML files within it:
   - It uses `os.walk` to iterate through the directory structure.
   - It creates asynchronous tasks for each HTML file, using `asyncio.create_task`.
   - It waits for all tasks to complete using `asyncio.gather`.

6. **Main Execution:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block runs the code when the script is executed. It sets the directory to process and calls `process_documents` to start the parsing process.

**In essence, this code takes a bunch of HTML files, cleans them up, sends them to a service to get embeddings, and stores everything in a database. This allows you to search and analyze your documents using the embeddings, making it easier to find relevant information.** 


## Explanation for `./middleware/redirects.global.ts`
Okay, so this code snippet is like a traffic cop for your website. It's called a "middleware" because it sits between your website and the user, checking things before they reach their destination.

This specific middleware is a "redirect" middleware. It's looking for users trying to access specific pages related to past elections (the `elections` array). If it finds them, it sends them to a new page (`/folketingsvalg-2022-valgtest`) instead, like a friendly detour. 

The `redirectCode: 301` tells the browser that this is a permanent redirect, so it should update its bookmarks accordingly. 

So, in short, this code ensures that anyone trying to access old election data is automatically redirected to the latest election results. It's like a "keep up with the times" feature! 


## Explanation for `./types/actors.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a pro! 

This file is all about defining different types of "actors" in a system. Think of it like a blueprint for creating characters in a game. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **`BaseActor`:** This is the foundation, the basic building block for all actors. It says every actor needs an `id` (a unique number), a `navn` (name), and a `type` (like "Committee" or "Politician").

2. **`Committee`, `Politician`, `Ministry`:** These are specific types of actors, each inheriting from `BaseActor`.  Notice how they all have a `type` property, but it's set to a specific value: 
    - `Committee` has `type: 'Udvalg'` (which probably means "committee" in Danish)
    - `Politician` has `type: 'Person'` 
    - `Ministry` has `type: 'Ministerium'`

3. **`Actor`:** This is a special type that says an actor can be *either* a `Committee`, a `Politician`, or a `Ministry`. It's like a catch-all for any of these specific actor types.

**In simpler terms:** This file is like a recipe book for creating different kinds of actors. You can use these recipes to build committees, politicians, and ministries, each with its own unique characteristics. 

Hope that makes sense!  Let me know if you have any other code snippets you want me to explain. 


## Explanation for `./types/meeting.ts`
Okay, so this code file is like a blueprint for how your program understands meetings. It's using a library called "drizzle-orm" to define the structure of your meeting data. 

Think of it like creating a form for entering meeting information. This code defines the fields in that form:

* **Meeting:** This defines the basic information about a meeting, like its date, time, and location. It's like the main part of your meeting form.
* **MeetingType:** This defines the type of meeting, like "regular meeting" or "emergency meeting." It's like a dropdown menu on your form.
* **MeetingAkt√∏r:** This defines the people involved in the meeting, like the attendees and organizers. It's like a section on your form where you list names.

The code uses `InferSelectModel` to automatically create these types based on the database schema defined in `../server/database/schema`. This means your program can easily work with meeting data without you having to write a lot of repetitive code. 

So, in a nutshell, this file sets up the building blocks for how your program understands and manages meeting data. 


## Explanation for `./types/akt√∏r.ts`
Okay, let's break down this code file! It's basically setting up the blueprints for different types of actors in your system. Think of it like creating character profiles for a game.

* **`akt√∏r`:** This is your main actor type, like the "Player" in a game. It's defined using `InferSelectModel`, which means it's pulling information from a database table called "akt√∏r".
* **`akt√∏rType`:** This is a type of actor, like "Warrior" or "Mage" in a game. It's also defined using `InferSelectModel`, pulling from a database table called "akt√∏rtype".
* **`Akt√∏rAkt√∏rRolle`:** This is a type of role an actor can have, like "Leader" or "Follower" in a game. It's defined using `InferSelectModel`, pulling from a database table called "sagAkt√∏rRolle".
* **`Akt√∏rAkt√∏r`:** This is a type of relationship between actors, like "Friend" or "Enemy" in a game. It's defined using `InferSelectModel`, pulling from a database table called "akt√∏rAkt√∏r".

So, this file is essentially defining the building blocks for your actors and their relationships, making sure your code knows what kind of data to expect when working with them.  It's like setting up the character creation screen in a game, but instead of choosing a class, you're defining the types of data you'll be working with. 


## Explanation for `./types/sag.ts`
Alright, let's break down this TypeScript file! It's basically a blueprint for how data about "sags" (cases) is structured and accessed in your application. Think of it as a super-organized filing system for all your case information.

**The Basics**

* **Imports:**  The file starts by importing some tools from `drizzle-orm` (a library for working with databases) and your database schema (`schema.ts`). 
* **Base Types:**  It defines basic types like `Sag`, `Sagstrin`, `Dagsordenspunkt`, etc. These represent different kinds of data in your database, like a case itself (`Sag`), a case stage (`Sagstrin`), or an agenda item (`Dagsordenspunkt`). The `InferSelectModel` thing is just a fancy way of saying "get the type of data you'd get back from a database query."

**Relationships**

* **Extended Types:** The real magic happens with the `WithRelations` types. These are like the "folders" in your filing system. They tell you how different pieces of data are connected. For example, a `SagstrinWithRelations` includes not just the basic case stage info, but also a list of related agenda items (`dagsordenspunkt`) and actors involved (`sagstrinAkt√∏r`).
* **Complex Relationships:**  The code defines types for how documents (`Dokument`) are linked to files (`Fil`), how actors (`Akt√∏r`) are involved in cases (`SagAkt√∏r`), and so on.

**API Responses**

* **SagApiResponse:** This type describes the structure of data you'd get back from an API call to fetch a case. It could either be a `SagWithRelations` object (success) or an error message.
* **SagDetails:** This type describes the structure of a more detailed case response, including actors, documents, and speech segments.

**In a Nutshell**

This file is like a blueprint for organizing and accessing case data in your application. It defines types that ensure your data is structured consistently and makes it easy to work with relationships between different data pieces. 


## Explanation for `./composables/api.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code snippet. It's like a little recipe for how to organize information about different "feeds" (think of them like news channels).

**The `feedsInfo` object:**

This is like a menu, listing the different feeds available. Each feed has its own entry:

- **`lovforslag`:**  This feed is about "Lovforslag" (which translates to "Bills" or "Legislative Proposals"). It has a title and a `pages` property set to 10. This might mean there are 10 pages of content for this feed.
- **`sag`:** This one is about "Sag" (meaning "Case"). It has a title and `pages` set to 100, suggesting it has more content than the "Lovforslag" feed.
- **`afstemning`:** This feed is about "Afstemning" (meaning "Vote"). It also has a title and `pages` set to 10.

**The `validFeeds` variable:**

This line is like a helper that creates a list of all the feed names (keys) from the `feedsInfo` object. So, it would contain: `["lovforslag", "sag", "afstemning"]`. This list is handy for checking if a given feed is valid or not.

**In a nutshell:**

This code file defines a structure for storing information about different feeds and provides a way to easily list the available feeds. It's like a little map for navigating through different sources of information. 


## Explanation for `./composables/useCurrentPeriode.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code like a pro! 

This code file, `useCurrentPeriode.ts`, is basically a **helper function** for managing "periodes" (think of them like time periods or intervals). It's designed to be used in a Vue application, likely built with Nuxt.js.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Imports:** 
   - It imports `useMetaStore` which gives access to a store called `metaStore`. This store likely holds information about "periodes" and other meta-data.
   - It also imports `storeToRefs` which is a handy tool for working with Pinia stores (a state management library).

2. **`useCurrentPeriode` Function:**
   - This function is the heart of the file. It does two main things:
     - **Fetches Periodes:** It has a function called `fetchPerioder` that grabs a list of "periodes" from the `/api/perioder` endpoint. If there are no periodes in the `metaStore` yet, it makes this API call and stores the fetched data in the `metaStore`.
     - **Manages Current Periode:** It has a function called `setCurrentPeriode` that allows you to set the currently active "periode". It can either set it to `null` (no active periode) or to a specific periode from the list.

3. **Returns:**
   - The function returns an object containing:
     - `perioder`: A reactive reference to the list of all "periodes".
     - `currentPeriode`: A reactive reference to the currently active "periode".
     - `fetchPerioder`: The function to fetch "periodes" from the API.
     - `setCurrentPeriode`: The function to set the current "periode".

**In a nutshell:** This code provides a way to manage "periodes" in your Vue application. It fetches the list of periodes, lets you select the current one, and keeps track of both the list and the current selection.

**Think of it like this:** Imagine you're managing a calendar app. This code would help you fetch all the months of the year and then select the current month. You could then use the current month to display events or schedule tasks. 


## Explanation for `./composables/useSagDocuments.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code like a puzzle. It's basically a tool for fetching and managing documents related to a specific "SAG" (we'll assume it's some kind of project or item).

**The Setup:**

* **`Document`:** This is a blueprint for how each document looks. It has fields like `id`, `titel`, `content`, `htmlUrl`, etc. Think of it like a template for organizing document information.
* **`useSagDocuments`:** This is the main function. It takes a `sagId` (the ID of the SAG we're interested in) and sets up a few things:
    * **`documents`:** This is a reactive array (using `ref` from Vue) that will hold the fetched documents.
    * **`isLoading`:** This tells us if we're currently fetching documents (a handy flag).
    * **`error`:** This stores any error messages that might occur during fetching.

**The Action:**

* **`fetchDocuments`:** This is the heart of the code. It does the following:
    1. **Sets `isLoading` to `true`:**  Lets us know we're busy.
    2. **Clears any previous errors:**  Starts fresh.
    3. **Fetches data:**  Uses `useFetch` (a Vue library function) to grab documents from an API endpoint (`/api/sag/documents`) and filters them by the provided `sagId`.
    4. **Updates `documents`:**  If the fetch is successful, it populates the `documents` array with the fetched data.
    5. **Handles errors:**  If anything goes wrong during fetching, it sets the `error` message and logs the error to the console.
    6. **Sets `isLoading` to `false`:**  We're done fetching.

**The Return:**

* **`useSagDocuments`** returns an object containing:
    * **`documents`:** The array of fetched documents.
    * **`isLoading`:** The loading status.
    * **`error`:** Any error messages.
    * **`fetchDocuments`:** The function to trigger the fetching process.

**In a nutshell:** This code provides a way to fetch and manage documents associated with a specific SAG, giving you a simple interface to work with the data and handle loading and error states. 


## Explanation for `./composables/useAktorer.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a pro!

This file, `useAktorer.ts`, is like a handy tool for fetching and managing information about "actors" (think characters in a story, but in this case, probably people involved in a process).

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Imports:** It brings in some powerful tools:
   - `useQuery` from `@tanstack/vue-query`: This is a library that helps us fetch data efficiently and manage its state (loading, errors, etc.).
   - `useAkt√∏rStore` from `~/stores/akt√∏r`: This lets us access a "store" (like a central container) that holds information about actors.
   - `Actor`: This is a type definition (like a blueprint) for how an actor's data should look.

2. **Akt√∏rQueryParams:** This defines a structure for the parameters we can use to filter our actors. We can specify things like the case ID (`sagId`), time period (`periodId`), actor type, role, and even a search term.

3. **useAktorer function:** This is the main function of the file. It takes the `params` object (containing our filter criteria) and does the following:
   - **Creates a `getAkt√∏rer` function:** This function takes the `params` and builds a URL query string (like `?sagId=123&akt√∏rType=client`) to send to the server. Then, it uses `$fetch` to make a GET request to the `/api/actors` endpoint with those parameters.
   - **Uses `useQuery`:** This sets up a "query" that will fetch the actors based on the `params` and manage the loading state, errors, and data.
   - **Updates the Pinia store:** When the data changes, it updates the `akt√∏rStore` with the new actor data.
   - **Returns useful information:** The function returns an object containing:
     - `akt√∏rer`: A computed property (like a reactive variable) that gives us the list of actors.
     - `isLoading`: A boolean indicating if data is being fetched.
     - `error`: Any error that occurred during fetching.
     - `refetch`: A function to manually refresh the data.

**In essence, this file provides a convenient way to fetch and manage actors based on various criteria, making it easier to work with them in your Vue application.**


## Explanation for `./llm_service/main.py`
Okay, let's break down this Python code file! It's basically a **Danish-language question-answering service** built on top of a powerful language model (LLM) called "Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-8bit". Think of it as a smart assistant that understands Danish text and can generate questions based on it.

Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. **Imports:** The code imports libraries like `FastAPI` (for building web APIs), `transformers` (for working with LLMs), `torch` (for handling tensors), and `nltk` (for natural language processing).

2. **Setting up the API:** It creates a `FastAPI` app called `app` that will handle requests and responses.

3. **Preprocessing Danish Text:**  The `preprocess_danish_text` function cleans up Danish text by converting it to lowercase, removing extra whitespace, and potentially removing stopwords (common words like "the" and "a" that don't add much meaning).

4. **Splitting Text into Chunks:** The `split_text_into_chunks` function divides long pieces of text into smaller chunks, which is helpful for processing with LLMs.

5. **Loading the LLM:** It loads the "Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-8bit" LLM, which is a large language model trained on a massive dataset of text and code.

6. **Defining Request and Response Models:** The code defines classes like `DocumentRequest` and `DocumentResponse` to structure the data sent to and received from the API.

7. **API Endpoints:**

    * **`/process_document_embeddings`:** This endpoint takes a piece of Danish text as input, splits it into chunks, and generates embeddings (numerical representations) for each chunk using the Danish BERT model. Embeddings are used to understand the meaning of text.
    * **`/get_embedding`:** This endpoint takes a Danish text and generates a single embedding for it using the Danish BERT model.
    * **`/generate_question`:** This is the core functionality! It takes a piece of Danish text, preprocesses it, and uses the "Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410-8bit" LLM to generate a relevant question based on the text.
    * **`/health`:** This endpoint is a simple health check to see if the API is running.

8. **CORS Middleware:** This allows the API to be accessed from different origins (like a web application running on a different port).

9. **Running the API:** The code starts the API using `uvicorn` and listens for requests on port 8000.

**In essence, this code provides a web service that allows you to:**

* **Process Danish text and get embeddings:**  Understand the meaning of Danish text by converting it into numerical representations.
* **Generate questions from Danish text:**  Ask the LLM to create a question based on a given piece of Danish text.

This is a simplified explanation, but it gives you a good understanding of the core functionality of the code. 


## Explanation for `./config/xml_comparer.py`
Alright, let's break down this Python code. It's like a detective story for XML files! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**The Goal:**

This code compares the structure of multiple XML files, focusing on their metadata (like what kind of data they hold). It then neatly organizes the comparison results into a text file.

**The Steps:**

1. **XML Structure Extraction:**
   - It uses `xml.etree.ElementTree` to parse each XML file and build a "tree" representation.
   - The `extract_structure` function walks through this tree, recording the tags (like "person", "address") and their attributes (like "name", "street").

2. **Metadata Extraction:**
   - It has a separate function (`extract_metadata_structure`) for parsing a specific "metadata.xml" file.
   - This file defines the data model, describing the entities (like "Meeting", "Participant") and their properties (like "Title", "Email").

3. **Mapping:**
   - The `map_to_metadata` function connects the extracted XML structure to the metadata.
   - It matches the tags in the XML files to the entities defined in the metadata.

4. **Comparison:**
   - The `compare_mapped_structures` function compares the mapped structures of all the XML files.
   - It checks if each entity is present in every file and if the attributes match the metadata definition.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the comparison results are written to a file named "comparison_result.txt".
   - This file shows which entities are present in each file, their attributes, and if they match the metadata properties.

**In a nutshell:** This code helps ensure that all your XML files are structured consistently and follow the defined metadata rules. It's like a quality control check for your data! üëç


## Explanation for `./config/rename_postgres.py`
Alright, let's break down this Python script! It's basically a database janitor, cleaning up table and column names in your PostgreSQL database. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Imports:**  The script starts by importing the `psycopg2` library, which is your go-to tool for interacting with PostgreSQL databases.

2. **Special Character Map:**  The `char_map` dictionary defines a set of special characters (like √¶, √∏, √•) and their replacements (ae, oe, aa). This is the heart of the renaming process.

3. **Database Connection:**  The script connects to your PostgreSQL database using the provided credentials (database name, username, password, host, and port).

4. **Table Renaming:**
   - It fetches all table names from the database.
   - For each table, it checks if it contains any special characters from the `char_map`.
   - If a special character is found, it replaces it with the corresponding replacement from the `char_map`.
   - If the table name has changed, it renames the table in the database.

5. **Column Renaming:**
   - For each table, it fetches all column names.
   - It then performs the same character replacement process on each column name.
   - If a column name has changed, it renames the column in the table.

6. **Commit and Close:**  Finally, the script commits all the changes made to the database and closes the connection.

**In essence, this script automatically renames tables and columns in your PostgreSQL database by replacing special characters with their standard equivalents. It's like a little database beautification tool!** 


## Explanation for `./config/download_oda_bak.py`
Okay, so this Python code is basically a little file downloader. Think of it like a digital librarian who goes online, grabs a specific file, and saves it to your computer. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Imports:** It starts by bringing in the `requests` library, which is like a tool for talking to websites.
2. **Credentials:**  It sets up the website address (`url`), username, and password needed to access the file.
3. **Download:** It uses `requests.get` to fetch the file from the website, using the provided credentials.
4. **Save:** Finally, it opens a file called "oda.bak" on your computer and writes the downloaded data into it.

So, in a nutshell, this code downloads a file called "oda.bak" from a website using a specific username and password. Pretty simple, right? 


## Explanation for `./config/parse_meetings.py`
Alright, let's break down this Python code file, `parse_meetings.py`. It's like a detective who goes through a bunch of meeting transcripts (in XML format) and pulls out all the juicy details about who said what and when. 

**The Main Goal:**

This code file is designed to take a bunch of XML files representing meeting transcripts and transform them into a structured format that's easier to work with. Think of it like turning a messy pile of notes into a neat spreadsheet.

**How it Works:**

1. **`parse_speaker_data(metadata)`:** This function is like a mini-detective, taking in information about a speaker and extracting their name, role, and other details from the XML data.

2. **`parse_meeting_xml(file_path)`:** This is the main workhorse. It takes a single XML file, reads it, and then:
   - Extracts meeting metadata like date, session number, and the group involved.
   - Goes through each agenda item and extracts information like the item number, title, and any associated proposals.
   - For each speech within an agenda item, it calls `parse_speaker_data` to get the speaker's info and then grabs the speech content itself.

3. **`parse_all_meetings()`:** This function is the grand finale. It finds all the XML files in a specified directory, calls `parse_meeting_xml` on each one, and stores the results in a dictionary. This dictionary is like a master list of all the meetings and their details.

**In a Nutshell:**

This code file is a powerful tool for analyzing meeting transcripts. It takes messy XML data and turns it into a structured format that's ready for further analysis, like figuring out who spoke the most, identifying key themes, or even building a search engine for the meeting transcripts. 


## Explanation for `./config/analyse_meeting_xml.py`
Alright, let's break down this Python code. It's basically a detective for XML files, specifically those related to meeting minutes. Think of it as a super-powered librarian who can understand the structure of a book and also analyze the information inside.

**The code does two main things:**

1. **Structure Analysis:** It dives into the XML file and maps out its organization. Imagine the file is a family tree, and the code is tracing the branches and figuring out who's related to whom. This is done by the `print_structure` function.
2. **Data Analysis:** It extracts data from the XML file and tells you what kind of information it contains.  Think of it as the librarian reading the book and summarizing the main topics and characters. This is done by the `analyze_data` function.

**Let's break it down further:**

* **`analyze_xml_structure(xml_file_path)`:** This is the main function that kicks things off. It takes the path to the XML file as input.
* **`ET.parse(xml_file_path)`:** This line uses the `ElementTree` library (you need to import it) to read the XML file and create a tree-like representation of its structure.
* **`tree.getroot()`:** This gets the root element of the XML tree, which is like the main trunk of the family tree.
* **`print_structure(element, depth=0)`:** This function recursively explores the XML tree, printing out the tag names and their attributes. It uses indentation to show the hierarchical structure.
* **`analyze_data(element, path="")`:** This function analyzes the data within the XML tree. It collects all the text values and attributes, organizing them based on their location in the XML structure.
* **`data = analyze_data(root)`:** This calls the `analyze_data` function on the root element to get a dictionary of all the data found in the XML file.

**The commented-out code at the end is where the results would be written to a file. It shows how the data is presented:**

* **XML Structure:** Prints the hierarchical structure of the XML file.
* **Data Analysis:** Lists the unique values found for each data point and provides a sample of the values.
* **Possible connections to Prisma schema:** This part tries to map the data found in the XML file to a Prisma schema, which is a way to define data models for a database. This helps to understand how the data could be stored in a database.

**In a nutshell, this code is a handy tool for understanding the structure and contents of XML files related to meeting minutes. It helps you see the big picture and understand how the data is organized.** 


## Explanation for `./plugins/vue-query.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code like a pro! 

This file is like the backstage crew for your Vue app, specifically for managing data fetching with Vue Query. It's all about making sure your data is fresh and available, even when you're navigating between pages. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Imports:** We're bringing in some fancy tools from the `@tanstack/vue-query` library. These tools help us fetch data, store it, and keep it up-to-date.

2. **State Management:** We're using `useState` to create a special container called `vueQueryState`. This container will hold the state of our data, like a backstage dressing room for our data actors.

3. **Query Client:** We create a `queryClient` which is like the stage manager for our data. It's responsible for fetching, caching, and updating data.

4. **Default Options:** We set some default rules for how our data should behave. For example, we tell the `queryClient` to only refresh data if the user is actively looking at the page (not in the background) and to keep data fresh for 5 minutes.

5. **Vue Query Plugin:** We use the `VueQueryPlugin` to integrate Vue Query into our Nuxt app, giving us access to all its awesome features.

6. **Server-Side Hydration:** If we're on the server, we use `dehydrate` to prepare our data for the client. Think of it like packing up the stage props for the next show.

7. **Client-Side Hydration:** If we're on the client, we use `hydrate` to bring our data back to life. It's like unpacking the props and setting up the stage for the show to begin!

In short, this code file makes sure that Vue Query is set up correctly in your Nuxt app, allowing you to fetch and manage data efficiently. It's like a backstage crew working tirelessly to ensure a smooth and successful performance for your data! 


## Explanation for `./plugins/init.server.ts`
Okay, so this code is like a little welcome mat for your server-side Nuxt application. It's a tiny file called `init.server.ts` that's used to set up some initial things when your server starts up.

Think of it like this: Imagine you're throwing a party. This file is like you setting up the music, making sure the lights are on, and maybe even putting out some snacks before your guests arrive.

The code itself is pretty simple:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtPlugin(() => {
  // console.info('init server');
})
```

It uses a function called `defineNuxtPlugin` to tell Nuxt that this file contains some setup instructions. Inside the function, you can add code to do things like:

* **Connect to a database:**  Imagine setting up the dance floor for your party.
* **Load some initial data:**  Like getting the snacks ready.
* **Set up any special server-side logic:**  Maybe you need to check if guests are on the guest list.

In this case, the code has a comment that says `// console.info('init server');`. This is just a placeholder, and you'd replace it with the actual setup code you need for your server.

So, in a nutshell, `init.server.ts` is a file that lets you customize what happens when your Nuxt server starts up. It's like a little backstage area where you can get everything ready before the show begins! 


## Explanation for `./plugins/device.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a detective cracking a case! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**The Big Picture**

This code file is a Nuxt plugin called `device.ts`. Its main goal is to figure out if the user is browsing on a mobile device or not. It does this by analyzing the user's browser's "User Agent" string, which is like a secret code that tells websites what kind of device is being used.

**The Code Breakdown**

1. **Regular Expressions:** The code starts by defining two regular expressions: `REGEX_MOBILE1` and `REGEX_MOBILE2`. These are like search patterns that look for specific keywords or patterns within the User Agent string. 

   - `REGEX_MOBILE1` searches for common mobile device names and brands (like "Android", "iPhone", "Blackberry", etc.).
   - `REGEX_MOBILE2` looks for specific mobile device model numbers.

2. **`isMobile` Function:** This function takes the User Agent string as input and uses the regular expressions to check if it matches any of the mobile device patterns. If it does, it returns `true` (meaning the user is on a mobile device), otherwise `false`.

3. **Getting the User Agent:** The code tries to get the User Agent string from the request headers (if available) or directly from the browser's `navigator` object.

4. **Providing the `isMobile` Function:** Finally, the plugin uses Nuxt's `provide` function to make the `isMobile` function available to all components within your Nuxt application. This means any component can now easily check if the user is on a mobile device by calling `useIsMobile()`.

**In a Nutshell**

This plugin is like a smart detective that sniffs out the user's device type and makes that information readily available throughout your Nuxt app. This allows you to tailor your app's behavior and appearance based on whether the user is on a mobile device or a desktop computer. üíªüì±


## Explanation for `./tests/server/oda/scheduler.test.ts`
Okay, so this code file is like a detective testing out a super-efficient data organizer called "ODA." 

The detective is using a special tool called "Vitest" to run these tests.  

Here's what's happening:

1. **"startSyncScheduler"** is like turning on the organizer's automatic update feature. The detective checks if it starts without any problems.
2. **"runManualSync"** is like manually telling the organizer to update. The detective makes sure this works smoothly too.
3. **"run scheduled sync"** is the most interesting part. Here, the detective sets up a fake clock to see if the organizer updates at the right time.  They pretend an hour has passed and check if the organizer did its job.

Basically, this code is ensuring that the ODA scheduler works as expected, both when it's on autopilot and when someone tells it to update.  Think of it as making sure the organizer is always keeping things nice and tidy! 


## Explanation for `./tests/server/oda/sync.test.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a boss! 

This code is basically a set of tests for a system that syncs data from some external source (likely a database) into a Nuxt application. Think of it like keeping your local copy of a document in sync with the one on Google Drive. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Imports:**  We're bringing in some tools to help us write the tests.  `vitest` is a testing framework, and `setup` is a function that sets up our testing environment.  We also import functions that handle syncing specific types of data, like `syncAkt√∏r` (likely for actors/users), `syncAfstemning` (maybe for voting data), and so on.

2. **The Test Suite:**  The `describe` block is like a folder for our tests, grouping them together.

3. **Setup:**  The `setup` function is called before any tests run to get everything ready.

4. **Individual Sync Tests:**  The `testIndividualSync` function is a helper to make our tests more concise. It takes a sync function (like `syncAkt√∏r`) and a name (like "Akt√∏r") and runs a test to make sure the sync function runs without errors.

5. **Testing Individual Syncs:**  We call `testIndividualSync` for each of our sync functions, ensuring that each type of data can be synced correctly.

6. **Full Sync Test:**  Finally, we have a test for `syncAllEntities`, which tries to sync all the data types at once.  This makes sure everything works together smoothly.

**In a nutshell, this code file is making sure that the system can correctly sync all the different types of data from the external source into the Nuxt application.** 


## Explanation for `./tests/e2e/index.ts`
Okay, let's break down this code file! 

`./tests/e2e/index.ts`  is the heart of your end-to-end (E2E) tests.  Think of it as the "director" of your testing crew.  It's responsible for setting up the stage, running the tests, and making sure everything works as expected in your real-world application. 

Here's the gist:

1. **Setting the Stage:** The file likely imports all the necessary tools for running your E2E tests.  This could include things like:
    * **Test Framework:**  A library like Cypress or Jest that helps you write and run tests.
    * **Page Objects:**  These are like blueprints for your application's pages, making it easier to interact with them during testing.
    * **Data:**  Maybe you need to load some sample data for your tests.

2. **The Play:**  The file then defines the actual tests themselves.  These tests will likely involve:
    * **Navigating:**  Going to different pages in your application.
    * **Interacting:**  Clicking buttons, filling out forms, and generally using your app as a real user would.
    * **Asserting:**  Checking that the app behaves as expected.  For example, "Did the correct message appear after I clicked the button?"

3. **Curtain Call:**  Finally, the file might include code to run the tests and report the results.

**In short, this file is the central hub for your E2E tests, orchestrating the entire testing process to ensure your application is working as intended.** 

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any specific part of the code! 


## Explanation for `./stores/meta.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a boss!

**The Big Picture:**

This code file defines a "store" called "meta" using a library called "Pinia" (think of it as a fancy toolbox for managing data in your application). This store is like a central hub for all things related to "perioder" (which probably means "periods" in your app).

**The Details:**

* **`interface Periode`:** This defines a blueprint for a "Periode" object. Each Periode has an `id`, a `titel` (title), and a `slutdato` (end date). It's like a template for creating Periode objects.

* **`useMetaStore`:** This is the actual store. It's created using `defineStore` and given the name "meta".

* **`state`:** This is where the store's data lives. It has two properties:
    * `perioder`: An empty array that will hold all the Periode objects.
    * `currentPeriode`:  Initially set to `null`, this will hold the currently selected Periode.

* **`actions`:** These are like functions that let you interact with the store's data.
    * `setPerioder`: This action takes an array of Periode objects and updates the `perioder` array in the store.
    * `setCurrentPeriode`: This action takes a Periode object (or `null`) and updates the `currentPeriode` in the store.

**In a Nutshell:**

This code file creates a store that manages a list of "perioder" and allows you to select a specific "currentPeriode". It's like a little data manager for your app, keeping track of all the periods and letting you easily switch between them.

**Think of it like:**

You're building a website for a school. This store would hold all the information about different school terms (perioder) and let you easily switch between them to see the schedule for each term. 


## Explanation for `./stores/main.ts`
Okay, so this code file is like a little storehouse for information that your website needs. Think of it like a central hub for all the important stuff.

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **`import { defineStore } from 'pinia'`**: This line is like saying "Hey, I need a tool to create my store, and I'm getting it from this library called 'pinia'." Pinia is a popular library for managing state in Vue.js applications.

2. **`export const useMainStore = defineStore('main', { ... })`**: This line creates the store itself. It's named "main" and it's a special kind of store called "useMainStore" that you can access from other parts of your website.

3. **`state: () => ({ headerTitle: 'Parlamentet.dk ‚Äì deltagende demokrati' })`**: This is where the store actually keeps its information. Right now, it only has one piece of data: `headerTitle`, which is set to "Parlamentet.dk ‚Äì deltagende demokrati". This is probably the title of your website!

4. **`actions: { updateHeaderTitle(title: string) { this.headerTitle = title } }`**: This section defines how you can change the information in the store. In this case, you can use the `updateHeaderTitle` function to change the `headerTitle` to a new value.

**In short, this code file creates a store called "main" that holds the title of your website. You can use the `updateHeaderTitle` function to change the title if needed.** 

Let me know if you want to know more about how this code works in the context of a Vue.js application! 


## Explanation for `./stores/electionQuiz.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file! It's like a backstage pass to a political quiz show. 

**The Setup:**

* **`electionData.json` and `metaData.json`:**  Think of these as the "question bank" and "party profiles." They contain all the info for the quiz questions and party data.
* **`Party` and `Election` interfaces:** These are like blueprints for the data structures. They define what properties each party and election question should have (like initials, color, agreements, etc.).

**The Quiz Master:**

* **`useElectionQuizStore`:** This is the heart of the code. It's a "store" that manages all the quiz data and logic.
* **`state`:** This is where the quiz's current state lives. It holds things like:
    * `quiz`: The shuffled list of election questions.
    * `step`: The current question number.
    * `parties`: The shuffled list of parties.
    * `hasScrolled`:  Keeps track if the user has scrolled. 
* **`actions`:** These are like the quiz master's commands. They let you:
    * `reply`:  Record the user's answer to a question.
    * `nextStep`: Move to the next question.
    * `previousStep`: Go back to the previous question.
    * `setScroll`: Update the scroll status.
* **`getters`:** These are like the quiz master's insights. They calculate things based on the current state, such as:
    * `quizResult`:  Calculates how many times each party agrees or disagrees with the user's answers.
    * `sortedQuizResult`:  Sorts the parties based on their agreement percentage, making it easier to see who aligns most with the user's views.

**In a Nutshell:**

This code file creates a store that powers a political quiz. It loads data from JSON files, shuffles the questions and parties, tracks the user's progress, and provides insights into how each party aligns with the user's answers.  

**Think of it like this:** You're taking a political quiz, and this code is the backstage crew making sure everything runs smoothly, from shuffling the questions to calculating the results! 


## Explanation for `./stores/akt√∏r.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a boss! üòé

This file, `./stores/akt√∏r.ts`, is all about managing data related to "akt√∏rer" (which I'm guessing means "actors" in Norwegian, but hey, we're programmers, we can handle a little foreign language!). 

Think of it like a backstage area for your actors. You've got a list of all the actors (the `akt√∏rer` array) and a spotlight that can be focused on one actor at a time (the `selectedAkt√∏r`).

Here's the breakdown:

* **`defineStore`**: This is a tool from the Pinia library (a state management library). It's like a blueprint for creating a "store" that holds and manages data.
* **`Akt√∏r` interface**: This defines the structure of each actor. They have an `id` (a unique number) and a `navn` (their name).
* **`state`**: This is where the actual data lives. We have an empty array called `akt√∏rer` to store all the actors, and a variable called `selectedAkt√∏r` which is initially set to `null` (no actor is selected).
* **`actions`**: These are like functions that let you interact with the data. 
    * `setAkt√∏rer`: This function takes an array of actors and updates the `akt√∏rer` array.
    * `setSelectedAkt√∏r`: This function takes an actor (or `null` if you want to deselect) and updates the `selectedAkt√∏r` variable.

So, this code file basically sets up a way to keep track of your actors, add new ones, and focus on specific actors as needed. It's like a little backstage manager for your actors! üé≠ 


## Explanation for `./stores/sag.ts`
Okay, let's break down this code file, `stores/sag.ts`, like it's a piece of cake! üç∞

This file is all about managing data for something called a "Sag" (which I'm guessing is Danish for "case" or "matter"). Think of it as a little container for information about a specific case.

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Defining the Sag:**  The code first defines what a "Sag" looks like. It's like creating a blueprint for a house. It says a Sag has things like an ID, a title, a type ID, a category ID, and some other details.

2. **Creating the Store:** Then, it uses a library called "Pinia" to create a special store called `useSagStore`. This store is like a central hub where all the Sag information lives.

3. **The State:** The store has a `state` which is initially empty. It's like an empty box waiting to be filled with Sag data.

4. **The Action:** The store has an `action` called `setSag`. This action is like a little helper function. When you call `setSag`, it takes a Sag object and puts it into the store's empty box.

**So, in a nutshell, this code file creates a store to hold information about a single Sag. You can use the `setSag` action to fill the store with data about a specific Sag.**

Pretty simple, right?  Let me know if you want to explore any of these concepts in more detail! 


## Explanation for `./server/database/schema.ts`
This code file defines the database schema for your application using a library called `drizzle-orm`. Think of it like a blueprint for how your data is organized in your database. 

The code defines tables like `sag`, `dokument`, `akt√∏r`, `m√∏de`, and many more. Each table represents a different type of data in your application. For example, the `sag` table likely stores information about cases, while `dokument` stores information about documents related to those cases. 

Each table has columns that define the specific data it stores. For example, the `sag` table has columns for `titel` (title), `nummer` (case number), `statusid` (status of the case), and many more.

The code also defines relationships between tables. For example, the `sagdokument` table links cases to documents, allowing you to easily find all documents related to a specific case.

Overall, this file is crucial for defining the structure of your database and ensuring that your application can store and retrieve data in a consistent and organized manner. It's like the foundation of your data world! 


## Explanation for `./server/database/relations.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file! It's basically the "relationship map" for your database. Think of it like a family tree, but for all the different types of data in your system.

**What's happening?**

This file uses the `drizzle-orm` library to define how different tables in your database are connected. It's like creating a blueprint for how your data interacts.

**Here's the gist:**

1. **Import Tables:** The file starts by importing all the tables defined in your database schema (`./schema`). These are things like `afstemning` (voting), `akt√∏r` (actor), `dokument` (document), and so on.

2. **Define Relations:** For each table, it defines relationships using the `relations` function. This function lets you specify:
   - **One-to-one:** A single record in one table corresponds to a single record in another table.
   - **One-to-many:** One record in one table can have multiple related records in another table.
   - **Many-to-many:** Records in both tables can have multiple related records in the other.

3. **Relationship Details:** For each relationship, you specify:
   - **Fields:** The columns in each table that link them together.
   - **References:** The corresponding columns in the related tables.
   - **Relation Name:** A custom name for the relationship (optional).

**Example:**

Let's look at the `afstemningRelations` (voting relations):

```typescript
export const afstemningRelations = relations(afstemning, ({ one }) => ({
  afstemningstype: one(afstemningstype, {
    fields: [afstemning.typeid],
    references: [afstemningstype.id],
  }),
  // ... other relations
}))
```

This defines that each `afstemning` record has a single related `afstemningstype` record. They are linked by the `typeid` column in `afstemning` and the `id` column in `afstemningstype`.

**Why is this important?**

These relationships are crucial for:

- **Querying Data:** You can use these relationships to easily retrieve related data with `drizzle-orm`. For example, you can fetch all the votes related to a specific meeting.
- **Data Integrity:** These relationships help ensure that your database is consistent. For example, if a meeting is deleted, all related votes will also be deleted.

**In a nutshell:** This file acts as a guide for `drizzle-orm` to understand how your database tables are connected. It makes your database operations more efficient and ensures data consistency. 


## Explanation for `./server/database/meta/0010_snapshot.json`
This JSON file is like a blueprint for a database, specifically for a PostgreSQL database.  It's a snapshot of the database's structure at a particular point in time. Think of it as a map of all the rooms (tables) in a house, with details about each room, like the furniture (columns) and how the rooms connect (foreign keys).

Let's break it down:

* **"id"**: This is a unique identifier for this specific snapshot.
* **"prevId"**:  This points to the previous snapshot, allowing you to track changes over time.

   - **Step 2: Identify the voters:** It extracts the unique IDs of all the people who voted.
   - **Step 3: Determine the vote date:** It assumes all votes for a specific issue happen on the same day and extracts the vote date.

4. **Party Affiliations:** Now, the code needs to figure out which party each voter belonged to *at the time of the vote*. This is like finding out if a witness had any connections to the suspects.
   - **Step 4: Find party affiliations:** It queries the database to get the party affiliations of each voter at the time of the vote. It checks if the voter was a member of a party at that time.
   - **Step 5: Create a map:** It creates a map that links each voter's ID to their party affiliation.

5. **Tallying the Votes:** The code then aggregates the votes by party, like counting the votes in each suspect's favor.
   - **Step 6: Count votes by party:** It goes through each vote and adds it to the corresponding party's tally, based on how the voter voted (for, against, abstain, absent).

6. **The Verdict:** Finally, the code calculates the stance of each party on the issue, based on the aggregated votes.
   - **Step 7: Calculate party stances:** It determines the stance of each party (for, against, abstain, neutral) based on the number of votes for, against, abstain, and absent.
   - **Step 8: Return the results:** It returns the individual votes and the party stances as the final result.

7. **Error Handling:** The code includes error handling, like a detective making sure their evidence is reliable. If anything goes wrong, it throws an error message.

In short, this code file is like a detective investigating a political case. It gathers evidence (votes), analyzes it (finds party affiliations), and presents the results (party stances). It's a fascinating example of how code can be used to understand complex political dynamics! 


## Explanation for `./server/api/sag/all.ts`
Okay, let's break down this code like a pro!

This code file, `./server/api/sag/all.ts`, is like a little server-side ninja that fetches data from a database and sends it back to the front-end. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Imports:** It starts by bringing in some tools:
   - `desc` from `drizzle-orm`: This helps us order data in descending order (newest to oldest).
   - `defineEventHandler` from `h3`: This is the magic that lets us create an API endpoint.
   - `db`: This is our connection to the database.
   - `sag`: This is the table we want to work with (probably a table holding information about "sag" - maybe some kind of case or record?).

2. **The API Endpoint:** 
   - `export default defineEventHandler(...)`: This line defines the API endpoint.  Think of it like a door in your server that someone can knock on to get data.

3. **Fetching Data:** 
   - `const sagList = await db.select().from(sag)...`: This is where the action happens! It's like sending a query to the database, asking for all the records in the `sag` table.
   - `.orderBy(desc(sag.opdateringsdato))`: This part sorts the records by the `opdateringsdato` column (probably a date field) in descending order, so the newest records are at the top.
   - `.limit(10)`: This limits the number of records returned to just the top 10.

4. **Handling Errors:**
   - `try...catch`: This is like a safety net. If something goes wrong while fetching data, the `catch` block will handle it gracefully. It logs the error and sends a simple error message back to the front-end.

5. **Sending the Data:**
   - `return sagList || []`:  Finally, the code sends the fetched data (the `sagList`) back to the front-end. If there's no data, it sends an empty array.

**In a nutshell:** This code file creates an API endpoint that fetches the 10 most recent records from the `sag` table in the database and sends them back to the front-end.  It's a simple but powerful way to access and manage data! 


## Explanation for `./server/api/sag/documents.ts`
Okay, let's break down this code file! It's basically a document retrieval system for a case management system. Think of it like a virtual filing cabinet for cases. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Imports:** It brings in tools like `defineEventHandler` (for handling web requests), `createError` (for sending error responses), `getQuery` (for getting data from the request), `eq` and `and` (for building database queries), `db` (the database connection), and the database schemas (`sagdokument`, `fil`, `filContent`).

2. **FileWithContent Type:** This defines the structure of the data we'll return. It includes file details like ID, title, URL, and importantly, the content of the document.

3. **The Main Function:** This is the heart of the code. It's triggered when someone requests documents from the server:
    * **Gets the Case ID:** It extracts the case ID (`sagId`) from the request.
    * **Handles Invalid Input:** It checks if the ID is a valid number. If not, it sends an error message.
    * **Database Query:** It fetches documents related to the case from the database (`sagdokument`). It also includes related information like the file (`fil`) and its content (`filContent`).
    * **Content Retrieval:** It loops through each file and tries to fetch the content from the database. If the content is not found, it returns a message indicating that.
    * **Error Handling:** It includes error handling to catch any problems during the process and send appropriate error responses.

**In a nutshell, this code file takes a case ID as input, fetches all the documents associated with that case from the database, and returns the documents with their content (if available).**

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any specific part of the code! 


## Explanation for `./server/api/sag/index.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file, which is like a little detective searching for a specific case file!

**The Goal:**

This code is designed to fetch information about a single "sag" (which might be a case file or a project) based on its unique ID.  Think of it like looking up a case file by its number.

**The Steps:**

1. **Get the ID:** The code first grabs the ID from the request's query parameters. It makes sure the ID is a valid number, otherwise it throws an error.

2. **Database Query:**  The code uses a database library called "drizzle-orm" to fetch the "sag" data from the database. It does this by looking for a specific record where the "id" matches the provided ID. 

3. **Deep Dive:**  It doesn't just grab the basic "sag" information. It also wants to get all the related data, like:
    * **sagstrin:**  Details about the stages of the case.
    * **sagdokument:**  Documents related to the case.
    * **sagAkt√∏r:**  People involved in the case.

4. **Check for Success:** If the code finds the "sag" with the matching ID, it sends the complete data back as a response. If not, it throws an error saying the "sag" wasn't found.

**In a Nutshell:**

This code file is like a librarian who can locate a specific case file and pull out all the relevant documents and information about the people involved. It's a crucial part of a system that manages and retrieves case information. 


## Explanation for `./server/api/sag/list.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file! It's basically a "search engine" for "sag" (which I'm assuming means "case" in Danish). 

**Here's the gist:**

1. **Setting the Stage:** The code uses a library called "h3" to create an API endpoint that can be accessed by other parts of the application. It also uses "drizzle-orm" to interact with a database.

2. **Getting the Search Criteria:** The code grabs all the search parameters from the request, like the period, committee, politician, ministry, date, search text, page number, and page size.

3. **Building the Query:** It then constructs a complex database query using "drizzle-orm" to fetch "sag" data based on the provided search parameters. The query can be filtered by:
    * **Period:**  Filtering by the period the case belongs to.
    * **Committee:** Filtering by the committee associated with the case.
    * **Politician:** Filtering by the politician involved in the case.
    * **Ministry:** Filtering by the ministry related to the case.
    * **Date:** Filtering by the update date of the case.
    * **Search Text:** Searching for specific keywords in the case title, number, or summary.

4. **Pagination:** It handles pagination, allowing the user to browse through the results in chunks.

5. **Returning the Results:** Finally, it returns the search results, including the list of "sag" items, the total number of pages, the current page, the page size, and the total count of "sag" items matching the search criteria.

**In simpler terms:** Imagine you're searching for a specific document in a massive library. This code file acts like a librarian who can help you find the document based on your search terms (like the author, title, or subject). It also helps you navigate through the library by showing you the total number of pages and the current page you're on.

**Important Note:** The code uses specific IDs (like 3, 5, and 8) to identify different types of actors (committees, politicians, and ministries). This suggests that the database has a structured way of classifying these actors.

Let me know if you have any more questions! 


## Explanation for `./utils/oda.ts`
This code file defines a TypeScript library for interacting with an OData API. It's like a set of tools that let you talk to a database using a specific language (OData). 

The file defines a bunch of "types" which are like blueprints for the data you'll be working with. Each type represents a table in the database, like "Afstemning" (voting), "Akt√∏r" (actor), "Dokument" (document), and so on. 

The file also provides functions for interacting with the API. These functions let you:

* **Get data:**  Fetch data from a specific table (like `afstemningGet` for fetching voting data).
* **Create data:** Add new entries to a table (like `afstemningPost` for creating a new voting record).
* **Update data:** Modify existing entries in a table (like `afstemningIdPatch` for updating a specific voting record).
* **Delete data:** Remove entries from a table (like `afstemningIdDelete` for deleting a specific voting record).

The functions are designed to be used with a `Context` object, which provides information about the API endpoint and authentication methods.

Overall, this file provides a convenient way to access and manipulate data from an OData API. Think of it as a translator that helps you speak the OData language to the database! 


## Explanation for `./utils/cli.ts`
Okay, so this code file is like a little command center for your program. It's basically a tiny boss that tells other parts of the program what to do. 

Think of it like this: you're the boss, and you have a team of workers (like `logAllEntities`). This code lets you tell your team what to do by typing commands in your terminal.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **`#!/usr/bin/env node`**: This line tells your computer to use Node.js to run this file. It's like saying "Hey, computer, use this special program to understand this code."

2. **`import { logAllEntities } from './logEntities'`**: This line brings in a function called `logAllEntities` from another file. It's like saying "Hey, team, I need you to use this function."

3. **`const command = process.argv[2]`**: This line grabs the second word you typed in the terminal after the program's name. It's like you telling your team "Okay, what do you want to do?"

4. **`if (command === 'logEntities') { ... }`**: This checks if the command you typed is "logEntities". If it is, it tells the `logAllEntities` function to do its thing. It's like you saying "Okay, team, log all the entities!"

5. **`else { ... }`**: If you typed something other than "logEntities", it tells you that you typed an unknown command. It's like you saying "Sorry, I don't understand what you want me to do."

So, basically, this code file lets you run the `logAllEntities` function by typing `node ./utils/cli.ts logEntities` in your terminal. It's a simple but powerful way to control your program! 


## Explanation for `./utils/logger.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a pro! 

This file is all about **logging**, which is basically like keeping a diary for your code. It helps you track what's happening in your program, especially when things go wrong. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Importing the "consola" library:** This line brings in a fancy logging tool called "consola". It's like a super-powered diary that makes logging easier and more organized.

2. **Configuring "consola":**  This part sets up how "consola" will behave. It checks if your program is running in "production" mode (like on a live website) or "development" mode (for testing). If it's production, it sets the logging level to "info" (only important stuff), and if it's development, it sets it to "debug" (more detailed information).

3. **Exporting "consola":** This line makes the "consola" logger available for other parts of your code to use. It's like handing out a pen and paper so everyone can write in the diary.

**In short, this file sets up a logging system that lets you keep track of what your code is doing, and it's smart enough to adjust how much detail it logs based on whether you're testing or running the program live.** 


## Explanation for `./utils/logEntities.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file. It's like a detective story, but instead of solving crimes, it's investigating data!

**The Big Picture**

This file is all about **logging data from different entities** in a system. Think of it like a detective taking notes on suspects ‚Äì each entity is a piece of information, and this code is recording them.

**The Players**

* **`oda`:** This is a library (like a toolkit) that provides functions to fetch data from various entities.
* **`createContext`:** This function creates a context, which is like a backstage pass for accessing the data.
* **`entities`:** This array holds a list of all the entities we want to log. Each entity is an object with a `name` (like "Afstemning" ‚Äì which sounds like a Danish word for "vote") and a `getter` function (from the `oda` library) that knows how to fetch data for that entity.

**The Action**

1. **Create a context:**  The code starts by creating a context using `createContext()`.
2. **Loop through entities:** It then goes through each entity in the `entities` array.
3. **Fetch data:** For each entity, it calls the `getter` function to fetch the first item (using `$top: 1`) and logs the name of the entity and the fetched data.
4. **Handle errors:** If there's a problem fetching data, it logs an error message.

**The Outcome**

This code will print a list of data for each entity in the console. It's like a detective's notebook, showing all the information they've gathered. This can be useful for debugging, understanding the data structure, or simply getting a quick overview of the system's data.

**In a nutshell, this code is like a data detective, gathering information from various entities and presenting it in a clear and organized way.** 


## Explanation for `./components/FilterSection.vue`
Alright, let's break down this code file, `FilterSection.vue`, like it's a puzzle! üß©

This file is a Vue component that creates a section for filtering data. Imagine it as a control panel for narrowing down your search results.  

**Here's how it works:**

1. **The Template:** The `<template>` section defines the visual layout of the filter section. It uses a grid to arrange different filter elements, like:
   - **Dropdown Menus:**  These menus (`USelectMenu`) allow users to select a specific value from a list. For example, you can filter by "periode" (period), "udvalg" (committee), "politiker" (politician), or "ministerium" (ministry).
   - **Date Input:**  A date picker (`UInput`) lets users select a specific date for filtering.
   - **Search Bar:**  A text input (`UInput`) allows users to enter a search query.

2. **The Script:** The `<script>` section handles the logic behind the filter section. It does the following:
   - **Props:** It receives data from the parent component, like lists of "perioder" (periods), "committees", "politicians", and "ministries". It also receives the current filter values (e.g., selected period, date).
   - **Computed Properties:** It uses `computed` properties to create reactive variables that are linked to the props. This means that whenever a filter value changes, the component automatically updates.
   - **Emits:** It emits events whenever a filter value changes. This allows the parent component to know about the updated filter settings.

**In a nutshell:** This `FilterSection.vue` component provides a user interface for filtering data. It takes filter values as input, updates them when the user interacts with the filters, and communicates these changes to the parent component. 

Think of it like a powerful tool for organizing and finding the information you need! üîç 


## Explanation for `./components/PartyItem.vue`
Alright, let's break down this Vue component, `PartyItem.vue`, like it's a political debate! 

**The Big Picture:**

This component is designed to display information about a political party in a visually appealing way. Think of it as a mini-profile for each party. It shows the party's logo, a progress bar representing their agreement percentage, and some key stats.

**Let's Dive In:**

* **Template:** The `template` section is the visual part. It's like the stage where the party information is presented.
    * **Logo:** The `img` tag displays the party's logo. It uses dynamic binding (`:src`, `:alt`, `:title`) to fetch the logo from the `party` object passed as a prop.
    * **Progress Bar:** The `div` with the class `progress-bar` is the star of the show. It's a colorful bar that visually represents the party's agreement percentage.
        * **Width:** The width of the bar is dynamically calculated based on the `computedWidth` value, which takes into account the party's agreements and disagreements.
        * **Color:** The bar's background color is set using the `party.color` property.
        * **Text:** The text inside the bar shows the number of agreements, disagreements, and the calculated percentage.
* **Script:** The `script` section is where the logic happens. It's like the backstage of the show.
    * **Props:** The component receives two props: `party` (an object containing party information) and `normalize` (a boolean indicating whether to normalize the progress bar width).
    * **Computed Properties:** The `computed` properties are like backstage calculations that are used to dynamically update the view.
        * `computedPct`: This calculates the percentage of agreements based on the party's data.
        * `computedWidth`: This calculates the width of the progress bar, applying normalization if needed.
* **Style:** The `style` section is for styling the component. It's like the stage lighting and decorations.
    * **Progress Bar Transition:** This adds a smooth animation to the progress bar when its width changes.

**In a Nutshell:**

This component takes a party object as input and displays a visually appealing representation of the party's agreement percentage, logo, and other relevant information. It's a neat way to present political data in a user-friendly and interactive manner. 


## Explanation for `./components/Question.vue`
Okay, let's break down this Vue component! It's basically a fancy question card for an election quiz. 

**The Big Picture**

Imagine you're taking a quiz about political proposals. This component displays one question at a time, along with buttons to answer "yay" or "nay".  It also lets you navigate between questions.

**Let's Dive In**

* **`template`:** This is the HTML structure of the component. 
    * It uses a `UCard` (probably a fancy card component from a UI library) to contain the question.
    * The question title is displayed using `UTypography` (another UI component).
    * There are buttons for "yay", "nay", and to move to the next or previous question.
    * A "Read More" button is shown on larger screens.
* **`script setup`:** This is where the JavaScript logic lives.
    * **`useElectionQuizStore`:** This line connects the component to a store (think of it like a central data hub) called `electionQuizStore`. This store likely holds the quiz questions, the user's answers, and the current step in the quiz.
    * **`question`:** This is a computed property that dynamically gets the current question from the store based on the current step.
    * **`nextStep`, `previousStep`:** These functions update the current step in the store when the user clicks the navigation buttons.
    * **`updateAnswer`:** This function is called when the user clicks "yay" or "nay". It does a few things:
        * It saves the answer to the store.
        * It sends the answer to the server using `fetch` (this is how the quiz data is saved).
        * It scrolls to the next question smoothly.
    * **`saveAnswer`:** This function handles sending the answer to the server. It sends a POST request to `/api/vote` with the question details and the user's vote.

**In a Nutshell**

This component is the heart of the election quiz. It displays questions, lets users answer, and manages the navigation between questions. It also saves the user's answers to the server. 


## Explanation for `./components/Parties.vue`
Alright, let's break down this code like a pro!

This code snippet defines a Vue component called `Parties.vue`. It's basically a fancy list that displays information about political parties. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

* **`template`:** This section defines how the component looks on the screen. It uses a `transition-group` to make the list items appear and disappear smoothly.
* **`v-if="!parties"`:** This checks if a list of parties (`parties`) is provided. If not, it displays the results from the `electionQuizStore`.
* **`v-for="(party, idx) in ..."`:** This loops through the list of parties and displays each party using a `PartyItem` component.
* **`:party="party"`:** This passes the current party data to the `PartyItem` component.
* **`:normalize="normalize"`:** This passes a boolean value to the `PartyItem` component, which likely controls how the party information is displayed (e.g., normalized percentages).
* **`script setup`:** This section defines the logic behind the component. It uses a store called `electionQuizStore` to access data about the election quiz.
* **`defineProps`:** This defines the properties that the component can accept. It can receive a list of parties (`parties`) and a boolean value (`normalize`).

**In short, this component is a flexible list that can display either the results of an election quiz or a custom list of parties, with the ability to control how the information is presented.**

Think of it like a dynamic party list that can be customized based on different scenarios! 


## Explanation for `./components/FilContent.vue`

* **`FilContent.vue`:** This is a Vue component, like a building block for your web page. It's responsible for displaying the file list.
* **`template`:** This section defines the HTML structure of the component.
* **`UAccordion`:** This is a component from a UI library (probably `PrimeVue` or `Vuetify`) that provides the accordion functionality.
* **`accordionItems`:** This is a computed property that transforms the `files` data (received from the parent component) into an array of objects that the `UAccordion` component understands. It takes each `file` object and creates an `accordionItem` with a `label` (the file's title) and `content` (the file's data converted to a string).
* **`UButton`:** This is a button component that acts as the header for each accordion item. It displays the file number and title.
* **`Icon`:** These are icons from a library like `heroicons` that add visual cues (like the arrow to indicate expansion).

**In essence, this component takes a list of files, transforms them into accordion items, and displays them in a visually appealing way.**  The user can click on each item to expand and see the file's details.

**Think of it like a digital filing cabinet!** Each file is a drawer, and you can click on the drawer to open it and see what's inside. 


## Explanation for `./components/SagTimeline.vue`
Okay, let's break down this Vue component! It's basically a timeline builder, showing the steps of a "sag" (which probably means "case" or "file" in Danish). 

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **The Template:** This defines how the timeline looks. It uses a `ul` (unordered list) to display each step, and each step has:
    * **Date:** Shows the date of the step.
    * **Marker:** A little circle on the timeline.
    * **Title:** The title of the step.
    * **Description:**  Provides some details about the step.

2. **The Script:** This is where the magic happens. It fetches data and prepares it for the template:
    * **Fetching Data:** It uses `useRoute` to get the ID of the "sag" from the URL, then uses `useSagStore` and `useSagDocuments` to fetch the "sag" details and related documents.
    * **Computed Properties:** `sag` and `sagstrin` are computed properties. `sag` gets the "sag" data from the store, and `sagstrin` extracts the steps from the "sag" data.
    * **`onMounted`:** This function runs when the component is mounted. It fetches the "sag" data and documents.
    * **`formatDate`:** This function takes a date and formats it nicely.
    * **`getStepDescription`:** This function takes a step and creates a description using the available information. You can customize this to include more details.

3. **The Style:** This defines the visual appearance of the timeline, using CSS. It gives the timeline a clean and modern look.

**In a nutshell, this component does the following:**

* **Fetches data:** It retrieves the "sag" details and documents from the store.
* **Organizes data:** It extracts the steps from the "sag" data.
* **Renders the timeline:** It displays the steps in a visually appealing timeline format, including dates, titles, and descriptions.

   - It starts with a heading "Party Stances".
   - It shows a "Loading..." message while the data is being fetched.
   - If there's an error, it displays the error message.
   - If everything goes well, it displays a list of parties, each with:
     - The party's name.
     - A colored bar representing their stance ("For", "Against", or "Neutral"). The bar's width corresponds to the percentage of people within that party who hold that stance.

2. **The Script:** The `<script>` section contains the logic behind the component.
   - It uses `useRoute` to get the ID of the specific issue from the URL.
   - It fetches data about party stances from the `/api/sag/partyStances` endpoint using `useFetch`, passing the issue ID as a parameter.
   - The `getStanceColor` function determines the color of the bar based on the party's stance: green for "For", red for "Against", and gray for "Neutral". 

3. **The Style:** The `<style>` section defines the visual appearance of the component. It sets up the layout, colors, and sizes of the different elements.

**In a nutshell, this component fetches data about party stances on a specific issue, and then displays it in a visually appealing way, using colored bars to represent the percentage of people within each party who hold a particular stance.**

## Explanation for `./components/ProposalList.vue`
Alright, let's break down this Vue.js code. Imagine you're building a website to display a list of proposals, like maybe for new laws or projects. This code snippet is the heart of that list view.

**The `template` section is like the blueprint for how the list looks:**

* **`v-for` loop:** This is the magic! It takes an array of `proposals` (passed in from somewhere else) and creates a card for each one.
* **`card`:**  Think of this as a box for each proposal. It has a title (`proposal.titelkort`), a number (`proposal.nummer`), a short summary (`proposal.resume`), and the date it was updated.
* **`nuxt-link`:** This is a special link that lets you navigate within your website. Clicking it takes you to a page with more details about the proposal (using the proposal's ID).

**The `script setup` section is like the brain of this component:**

* **`defineProps`:** This tells the component that it expects an array called `proposals` to be given to it. It's like saying, "Hey, I need a list of proposals to work with!"

**In a nutshell, this code takes a list of proposals and turns them into a visually appealing list on your website, with links to view more information about each one.**

**Think of it like a fancy online catalog for proposals!**

## Explanation for `./components/SearchBar.vue`
Okay, so this code file is like a mini-search engine built into your Vue.js app. It's called `SearchBar.vue` because it's a component that lets users search for stuff. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **The Script:** The `<script>` tag is where the magic happens. It uses Vue's `ref` to create variables that hold the user's search query (`searchQuery`) and the results (`searchResults`).  The `performSearch` function is the heart of the search. It sends a request to your backend API (at `/api/search`) with the user's query.  The backend then sends back the results, which are stored in `searchResults`.  Finally, it emits a "search" event with the query, which other parts of your app can listen to.

2. **The Template:**  The `<template>` tag defines what the user sees. It has an input field where users type their query, a "Search" button, and a section to display the results.  The `v-model` directive links the input field to the `searchQuery` variable, so changes in the input are reflected in the variable and vice versa.  The `v-if` directive shows the results only if there are any.

**In a nutshell:** This component lets users search for things, sends their query to the backend, displays the results, and lets other parts of your app know what was searched for.  Pretty neat, right? 


## Explanation for `./components/Akt√∏rList.vue`
Okay, let's break down this code! It's basically a simple list of "akt√∏rer" (which sounds like actors in Norwegian, but could be anything really!).

**The Code's Story:**

1. **The Template:** This part is like the visual blueprint. It shows a heading "Akt√∏rer" and then either a "Loading..." message or a list of names. Each name comes from a `akt√∏r` object, which has an `id` and a `navn` (name).

2. **The Script:** This is where the magic happens. It uses a function called `useAktorer` to get a bunch of data about these "akt√∏rer." This data includes:
    * `akt√∏rer`:  An array of all the "akt√∏r" objects.
    * `isLoading`: A flag that tells us if the data is still being fetched.
    * `error`:  A flag that tells us if there was a problem getting the data.

3. **Error Handling:** If there's an error, it's logged to the console so the developers can fix it.

**In a Nutshell:** This code snippet fetches a list of "akt√∏rer" and displays their names in a simple list. It handles loading states and errors gracefully, making sure the user has a smooth experience. 


## Explanation for `./components/RandomQuestion.vue`
Alright, let's break down this code like a pro!

This Vue component, `RandomQuestion.vue`, is like a magic question box. It fetches a random question from a server (using `/api/randomQuestion`) and displays it to the user. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Template:** This is the HTML part. It shows a title "Random Question", an error message if something goes wrong, and the actual question and prompt (if available). It also has a button to fetch a new question.
* **Script:** This is the JavaScript part. It uses Vue's `ref` to store the question, prompt, error message, and loading state.
* **`fetchNewQuestion` function:** This is the heart of the component. It:
    * Clears any previous errors.
    * Sets the loading state to `true`.
    * Makes a request to the server to get a random question.
    * If the request is successful, it updates the `question` and `prompt` variables with the data received from the server.
    * If there's an error, it sets the `error` variable with the error message.
    * Finally, it sets the loading state back to `false`.
* **`onMounted`:** This runs the `fetchNewQuestion` function when the component is first loaded, so you get a question right away!

So, in simple terms, this component is a neat way to display a random question to the user, with error handling and a loading indicator to make the experience smooth. 


## Explanation for `./components/ColorModeButton.vue`
Okay, let's break down this Vue component! It's basically a fancy button that lets you switch between light and dark mode on your website. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **`useColorMode()`:** This line imports a function that lets the component know what the current color mode is (light or dark). It's like a little spy that tells the button what's up.

2. **`isDark`:** This is a special variable called a "computed property." It's like a smart calculator. It figures out if the current mode is dark by looking at the `colorMode` spy.  It also lets you change the mode by clicking the button!

3. **`template`:** This is where the button itself is defined. It uses a library called "Heroicons" to display either a moon icon (for dark mode) or a sun icon (for light mode). Clicking the button flips the mode and changes the icon.

4. **`ClientOnly`:** This makes sure the button only shows up after the website has fully loaded. It's like a little safety net that prevents the button from appearing too early.

**In a nutshell, this component is a simple but effective way to let users choose their preferred color mode and make your website more user-friendly!** 


## Explanation for `./components/PaginationControls.vue`
Alright, so this code snippet is like a little control panel for navigating through pages of data. Imagine you're browsing a website with lots of products ‚Äì this code is what lets you click "Previous" or "Next" to see different pages of products.

Here's the breakdown:

* **`template`:** This part defines what the user sees on the screen. It's basically a layout with two buttons ("Forrige" and "N√¶ste") and a text showing the current page number.
* **`currentPage` and `totalPages`:** These are variables that tell the code what page we're currently on and how many pages there are in total. They're passed in from somewhere else (like the parent component) and are essential for the buttons to work correctly.
* **`@click="$emit('change-page', currentPage - 1)"`:** This is the magic behind the "Forrige" button. When you click it, the code sends a message ("change-page") to the parent component, telling it to move to the previous page.
* **`@click="$emit('change-page', currentPage + 1)"`:** Same thing, but for the "N√¶ste" button. This sends a message to go to the next page.
* **`:disabled="currentPage === 1"`:** This makes the "Forrige" button inactive when you're on the first page, preventing you from going "backwards" beyond the beginning.
* **`:disabled="currentPage === totalPages"`:**  Similarly, this disables the "N√¶ste" button when you're on the last page.

So, in essence, this code creates a simple pagination control that allows users to move between pages of data, making sure they can't go beyond the first or last page. Pretty handy, right? 


## Explanation for `./components/PdfViewer.vue`
Alright, let's break down this Vue component, `PdfViewer.vue`, like it's a puzzle! 

**The Big Picture**

This component lets you display a PDF document within your web app. Think of it as a little PDF viewer built right into your page.

**The Breakdown**

* **Template:** This is the part that defines how the component looks. It has two main sections:
    * **Button:** This button, with the text "View PDF" (or whatever you set in `buttonText`), triggers the PDF viewing experience.
    * **PDF Container:** This is where the magic happens. When you click the button, this container appears, covering the entire screen with a semi-transparent black overlay. Inside, it displays the PDF using an `iframe` (like a little window within your window).
* **Script:** This is the brains of the operation, written in TypeScript. It handles the logic behind the scenes:
    * **Props:** This component takes two pieces of information from the outside world:
        * `pdfUrl`: This is the URL of the PDF file you want to display.
        * `buttonText`: This lets you change the text on the button if you want something different from "View PDF".
    * **`showPdf`:** This variable keeps track of whether the PDF viewer is currently open or closed.
    * **`openPdf`:** This function is called when you click the button. It checks if the `pdfUrl` starts with "http" (meaning it's a web URL). If it is, it opens the PDF in a new tab. If not, it means the PDF is stored locally, so it displays the PDF in the `iframe` within the component.
    * **`closePdf`:** This function is called when you click the close button (the "X") in the top right corner of the PDF viewer. It hides the viewer.

**In a Nutshell**

This component lets you easily display a PDF file, either by opening it in a new tab or by embedding it directly in your Vue app. It's a simple but effective way to add PDF viewing functionality to your web projects! 


## Explanation for `./public/mockServiceWorker.js`
Alright, let's break down this `mockServiceWorker.js` file. It's like a sneaky little helper that sits between your browser and your actual server, pretending to be the real deal! 

**The Big Picture:**

This file is part of a library called **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**.  It's a tool that lets you create fake responses for your web application's requests.  Think of it as a "test double" for your backend.  This is super helpful for:

* **Development:**  You can build your front-end without waiting for the backend to be ready.
* **Testing:**  You can write tests that are isolated from the real backend, making them faster and more reliable.

**How it Works:**

1. **Registration:**  The code registers itself as a Service Worker. This means it runs in the background, intercepting requests before they reach the real server.
2. **Communication:**  It uses messages to communicate with your web application, letting it know when mocking is enabled and sending back fake responses.
3. **Request Handling:**  When a request comes in, it checks if mocking is active and if there's a matching fake response defined in your code. If there is, it sends back the fake response. Otherwise, it lets the request go through to the real server.

**Key Parts:**

* **`activeClientIds`:**  A set that keeps track of which browser tabs are actively using the mock service worker.
* **`handleRequest`:**  This is the core function that handles incoming requests. It checks if mocking is active, resolves the main client, and sends the request to the client-side MSW library.
* **`getResponse`:**  This function fetches the response from the client-side MSW library, handles potential errors, and sends the response back to the browser.
* **`sendToClient`:**  This function sends messages to the browser tab that registered the service worker.

**In a Nutshell:**

This file is the "brains" of the mock service worker. It intercepts requests, communicates with your web application, and sends back fake responses, making development and testing a breeze! 


## Explanation for `./layouts/default.vue`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a boss! 

This file, `./layouts/default.vue`, is the blueprint for the basic structure of your web application. Think of it as the skeleton that holds everything together. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **`<template>`:** This tag defines the HTML structure of your page. 
* **`<div>`:** This is a simple container that holds the elements within it.
* **`<UNavbar>`:** This is a custom component (probably defined elsewhere) that renders a navigation bar. 
* **`<UNavbarItem>`:** These are the individual items in the navigation bar. Each item has a `to` attribute, which specifies the URL it links to.  
* **`<slot />`:** This is a special tag that acts like a placeholder. It allows you to insert different content into this layout depending on the specific page you're viewing. 

So, in essence, this code file defines a layout with a navigation bar at the top and a placeholder for the main content. When you navigate to different pages in your application, the content within the `<slot />` will change, but the navigation bar will remain consistent. 

Think of it like a website template where you can swap out the content in the middle, but the header and footer stay the same. 

Hope that makes sense! Let me know if you have any other questions. 


## Explanation for `./scripts/parseMeetings.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code file like a pro! 

This script, `parseMeetings.ts`, is basically a meeting organizer's best friend. It takes a bunch of meeting data (imagine a big spreadsheet of meeting details) and turns it into something much more useful.

Here's how it works:

1. **Import the parser:** It first brings in a function called `parseMeetings` from another part of the code. This function is the real magic worker, taking raw meeting data and transforming it into a structured format.
2. **Start the process:** It then kicks off a function called `runParser`. This is where the action happens.
3. **Time tracking:**  The code keeps track of how long the parsing takes, just like a stopwatch.
4. **Parsing magic:**  The `parseMeetings` function is called, and it does its thing, turning the raw data into a neat and organized collection of meetings.
5. **Success message:** Once the parsing is done, the code tells you how many meetings were parsed and how long it took, like a proud parent showing off their child's accomplishments.
6. **Error handling:**  If anything goes wrong during the parsing process, the code catches the error and lets you know, so you can fix it and keep the meeting train running smoothly.

In short, this script is a crucial part of a system that manages meetings. It takes raw data, cleans it up, and makes it ready for other parts of the system to use, all while keeping track of time and reporting any problems. 


## Explanation for `./scripts/processDocuments.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code! It's basically a document processing machine. 

**Step 1: Finding the Files**

First, the code goes hunting for HTML files in a specific directory (`assets/data/html`). It uses a recursive function to dive deep into the directory structure and grab all the HTML files it can find.

**Step 2: Parallel Processing**

Then, it gets smart. Instead of processing each document one by one, it divides the work among multiple worker threads. Think of it like having a team of assistants working on different documents simultaneously. This makes the whole process much faster!

**Step 3: Worker Threads**

Each worker thread gets a chunk of HTML files to process. They use a separate script (`./worker.ts`) to do their work. This script likely extracts information from the HTML files, like text content or metadata, and stores it in a database.

**Step 4: Database Storage**

The extracted information is then stored in a database using a library called `drizzle-orm`. This database could be used for various purposes, like searching, analysis, or building a knowledge base.

**Step 5: Wrap Up**

Finally, the main script waits for all the worker threads to finish their tasks. If everything goes smoothly, it prints a success message. If there are any errors, it logs them and exits the program.

**In a nutshell, this code is a powerful tool for processing large sets of HTML documents. It uses parallel processing and a database to efficiently extract information and make it readily available for further use.** 


## Explanation for `./scripts/worker.ts`
Alright, let's break down this worker script! It's like a little helper bot that processes documents and stores their information in a database. Here's the gist:

**1. Setup and Imports:**

* **`/// <reference lib="webworker" />`**: This line tells TypeScript that we're working with a Web Worker, a special kind of JavaScript code that runs in the background.
* **Imports:** We're importing libraries for file system access (`fs`), path manipulation (`path`), interacting with the database (`db`, `sql`, `eq`), making HTTP requests (`$fetch`), and defining the Worker type (`Worker`).

**2. Data Structures:**

* **`DocumentResponse`**: This type defines the structure of the data we get back from the embedding service. It includes the status of the process, the text chunks, and the corresponding embeddings.

**3. Text Cleaning:**

* **`extractMainContent`**: This function takes raw text and cleans it up. It removes things like page numbers, headers, footers, and common patterns that might interfere with embedding generation.

**4. Embedding Generation:**

* **`generateEmbedding`**: This function sends the cleaned text to an external service (likely a server running at `http://localhost:8000`) that calculates embeddings for the text. It then returns the `DocumentResponse` with the results.

**5. Document Processing:**

* **`processDocument`**: This is the core function. It takes a file path as input and does the following:
    * **Checks for existing data:** It looks in the database to see if the document has already been processed. If so, it skips it.
    * **Extracts main content:** It calls `extractMainContent` to clean up the text from the file.
    * **Generates embeddings:** It calls `generateEmbedding` to get the embeddings for the cleaned text.
    * **Stores data:** It iterates through the chunks and embeddings, storing them in the database along with other information like the file ID, extraction time, and version.

**6. Worker Message Handling:**

* **`self.onmessage`**: This event handler listens for messages from the main script. It expects a message containing an array of file paths.
* **Processing files:** It loops through the files and calls `processDocument` for each one.
* **Sending results:** Once all files are processed, it sends a "done" message back to the main script. If there's an error, it sends an "error" message with the error details.

**In short, this worker script takes a list of files, cleans their text, generates embeddings, and stores the results in a database. It's a crucial part of a system that likely uses these embeddings for tasks like document search or analysis.** 


## Explanation for `./pages/index.vue`
Okay, so this code file is like the blueprint for the home page of a website called "Danish Parliament Question Generator". 

**Think of it like this:** Imagine you're building a house. This file is the plan for the front room. It says, "Hey, this room should have a big title saying 'Welcome to the Danish Parliament Question Generator' and then put in a fancy widget called 'RandomQuestion' that does something cool."

**Here's the breakdown:**

* **`<template>`:** This part is like the furniture layout. It tells the website what to display on the page.
* **`<h1>Welcome to the Danish Parliament Question Generator</h1>`:**  This is the big title that greets visitors. 
* **`<RandomQuestion />`:** This is where the magic happens! It's a placeholder for a component called "RandomQuestion" that's probably responsible for generating random questions about the Danish Parliament. 

**The `<script setup>` part is like the instructions for the furniture:**

* **`import RandomQuestion from '~/components/RandomQuestion.vue'`:** This line tells the website to go find the "RandomQuestion" component, which is probably stored in a folder called "components".

**So, in short, this code file sets up the home page of a website that generates random questions about the Danish Parliament. Pretty neat, right?** 


## Explanation for `./pages/404.vue`
Okay, so this code file is like the "oops, you're lost!" page for a website called "Unfuck The System.dk".  

It's a Vue.js component, which means it's a little building block that makes up the website.  

Here's the breakdown:

* **`template`:** This part is like the HTML of the page. It shows a funny picture (probably a sad face or something) and a message saying "Oh ohno! We couldn't find that page." It also mentions that the page might be from an older version of the website and gives a link to the project's GitHub page for more info.
* **`script setup`:** This part is like the JavaScript code behind the scenes. It does a few things:
    * **`useMainStore`:** This imports a special "store" that holds some website-wide information.
    * **`useHead`:** This sets the title of the page in the browser tab to "Unfuck The System.dk ‚Äì side ikke fundet" (which means "page not found" in Danish).
    * **`onMounted`:** This runs some code when the page is loaded. It updates the website's header to show "404 ‚Äì side ikke fundet" as well.

So, basically, this file makes sure that if someone tries to go to a page that doesn't exist, they get a friendly message and a link to the project's code instead of just a boring error page.  It's like a little "oops" page for the website! 


## Explanation for `./pages/folketingsvalg-2022-valgtest.vue`
Alright, let's break down this code file like it's a political debate! 

**The Big Picture**

This file is the heart of a "Folketing Election 2022 Quiz" web page. It's a fun way for people to see how their political views align with the Danish political parties. Think of it like a "Which Hogwarts House Are You?" quiz, but for politics!

**The Code Breakdown**

* **Template:** This is the HTML structure of the page. It's got a progress bar (the little badge), a container for the quiz questions, and a "You're Done!" section at the end. 
* **Script:** This is the JavaScript logic behind the scenes. Here's the gist:
    * **Stores:** It uses two "stores" - `electionQuizStore` (holds the quiz questions and your answers) and `mainStore` (handles the page title).
    * **Quiz Logic:** It tracks your progress through the quiz, displays the questions, and handles the "previous step" button.
    * **Result Saving:** When you finish the quiz, it sends your answers (without the question titles) to the server using a `fetch` request.
    * **Head Meta:**  It sets the page title and some meta tags for search engines and social media.

**In a Nutshell**

This code file is a well-structured, interactive quiz that lets you test your political knowledge and see how your views compare to the Danish political landscape. It's a fun and engaging way to learn about politics! 


## Explanation for `./pages/test-api.vue`
Alright, let's break down this code. It's basically a simple test page for a backend API built with FastAPI. 

Think of it like this: you've got a fancy restaurant (your FastAPI backend) and this code is a little waiter (your Vue.js component) checking if the kitchen (your API) is open and ready to serve.

**Here's how it works:**

1. **The `template` section:**
   - It displays a "Test API" heading and a button that says "Test FastAPI Connection".
   - When you click the button, the `testApi` function gets called.
   - If the `result` variable has a value, it displays the result below the button.

2. **The `script` section:**
   - `result` is a variable that stores the response from the API. It starts as `null`.
   - `testApi` is the function that does the magic:
     - It logs a message to the console saying it's trying to connect to the FastAPI.
     - It uses `$fetch` to make a request to the `/api/test-fastapi` endpoint. This is like sending a message to the kitchen asking if they're open.
     - If the kitchen responds (the API returns a response), it stores the message in the `result` variable.
     - If there's an error (like the kitchen is closed), it logs the error and displays an error message in the `result` variable.

**In short, this code is a simple way to check if your FastAPI backend is up and running. It sends a request to a specific endpoint and displays the response or any errors that occur.** 


## Explanation for `./pages/valgtest-resultat.vue`
Alright, let's break down this Vue.js component! It's basically a results page for a political quiz, showing how people have answered various questions and what the overall "winner" parties are based on those answers. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

* **The `template`:** This is the HTML structure of the page. It's got headings, paragraphs explaining the data, and a couple of key components:
    * **`Parties`:** This is a reusable component that displays information about political parties. It's used twice: once to show the overall results and once to show the "winners" based on the quiz results.
    * **Progress bars:** These visually represent the percentage of "yes" and "no" answers for each question.
* **The `script`:** This is where the JavaScript logic happens. It uses a Vuex store (`useMainStore`) to manage data and uses `fetch` to get data from the backend API.
    * **`getResults`:** This function fetches data about the parties, including the number of agreements and disagreements for each party. It sorts the parties based on their agreement percentage and updates the `parties` variable.
    * **`getVotes`:** This function fetches data about the votes on each question, including the number of "yes" and "no" votes. It updates the `votes` and `winners` variables.
    * **`voteWidth`:** This function calculates the width of the progress bars based on the number of "yes" and "no" votes for each question.
* **`useHead`:** This function sets the page title and meta tags for SEO purposes.

**In essence, this component takes data from the backend API, processes it, and displays it in a user-friendly way, providing insights into the results of the political quiz.**

**Think of it as a "results dashboard" for the quiz, showing how people voted and which parties are doing well based on those votes.** 


## Explanation for `./pages/lovforslag/index.vue`
Alright, let's break down this Vue component! It's basically a fancy list of "lovforslag" (which I'm guessing means "bills" or "proposals" in Danish). 

**Here's the gist:**

1. **Data Fetching:** The component fetches a list of "lovforslag" from an API endpoint (`/api/sag/list`). It uses pagination to load data in chunks and a search feature to filter the results. 
2. **Search Functionality:** The component has a search bar that lets you type in keywords to find specific bills. It uses a debounce function to avoid making API calls for every keystroke, making the search more efficient.
3. **Period Selection:** You can choose a specific period to filter the bills. The component uses a dropdown menu to select the desired period. 
4. **Displaying Results:** The fetched bills are displayed in a list format, showing the title, number, summary, update date, and a link to view more details.
5. **Pagination:** The component includes pagination controls to navigate through the list of bills, making it easier to browse through large datasets.

**In simpler terms:**

Imagine you're browsing a library catalog. This component is like a digital catalog for bills. You can search for specific bills by title or keyword, filter them by the period they were introduced, and browse through the results using pagination. 

**Key takeaways:**

* This component uses Vue's reactive system to manage data and update the UI accordingly.
* It leverages composables (like `useDebounceFn`, `useAsyncData`, and `useCurrentPeriode`) to organize and reuse logic.
* The component uses a combination of Vue's built-in features (like `v-model`, `watch`, and `onMounted`) and custom components (like `USelectMenu`, `SearchBar`, and `PaginationControls`) to create a user-friendly interface.

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any specific part of the code! 


## Explanation for `./pages/lovforslag/[id].vue`
Alright, let's break down this Vue component! It's basically a detailed view for a specific "sag" (case) in a system. Imagine it like a case file in a legal system, but digital!

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Fetching the Sag:**
   - The component uses `useRoute()` to get the `id` of the sag from the URL.
   - It then makes a fetch request to `/api/sag` using `useFetch` to get the sag data based on the provided `id`.
   - The response is checked for success using a type guard, ensuring it's a valid `SagWithRelations` object.

2. **Displaying the Sag Details:**
   - The `sag` computed property holds the fetched sag data if the request was successful.
   - The template displays various details about the sag, including its title, number, status, public code, summary, and update date.
   - It also fetches and displays sagsstatus data to provide the status text based on the status ID.

3. **Sagstrin (Case Steps):**
   - The component iterates through the `sagstrin` (case steps) array, displaying each step's title, date, type ID, and involved actors.

4. **Dokumenter (Documents):**
   - It uses `useSagDocuments` to fetch documents related to the sag.
   - It displays the documents with their titles, formats, and previews (if available).
   - A PDF viewer component is used to display the documents.

5. **Akt√∏rer (Actors):**
   - It uses `useAktorer` to fetch actors associated with the sag.
   - It displays a list of actors involved in the case.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - The component handles potential errors during data fetching and displays appropriate error messages.

7. **Additional Features:**
   - The component includes a `PartyStanceVisualization` component, which is likely used to visualize the stances of different parties involved in the case.

**In essence, this component acts as a detailed view for a specific case, providing information about the case, its steps, related documents, involved actors, and potentially visualizing the stances of different parties.**

## Explanation for `./pages/lovforslag/fil/[id].vue`
Alright, let's break down this Vue code snippet like a boss! 

This code file, `./pages/lovforslag/fil/[id].vue`, is a Vue component that dynamically displays a file based on its ID. Think of it like a file viewer.

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Import the necessary tools:** We bring in `ref`, `useRoute`, `useAsyncData`, and `useSagStore`. These are like our handy tools for building the component.
2. **Get the file ID:**  The `useRoute` hook grabs the `id` from the URL, which tells us which file to fetch.
3. **Fetch the file data:** The `useAsyncData` hook does the heavy lifting. It fetches file data from the server using `$fetch` and stores it in the `content` variable. 
4. **Handle loading and errors:**  The `pending` variable tells us if the file is still loading, and `error` lets us know if there were any problems fetching it.
5. **Display the file:** The `FilContent` component is responsible for actually showing the file content. It receives the fetched data (`content`) as a prop.

**In a nutshell:**

This component dynamically fetches a file based on its ID, displays a loading message while it's fetching, and shows the file content once it's ready.  It's like having a little file viewer within your Vue app!

## Explanation for `./pages/ugeplan/index.vue`
Alright, let's break down this Vue component! It's basically a fancy calendar for meetings, allowing you to filter and view them based on date, person, and meeting type. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **The Template:**
   -  This is the HTML part that defines the layout and what the user sees.
   -  It has a filter section with:
      - A date picker to select the starting date of the week.
      - A dropdown to choose a person.
      - Checkboxes to select meeting types.
   -  The main part is a table that displays the weekly meetings.
   -  The table columns are: Date, Title, Start Time, Location, and Agenda Items.
   -  The agenda items are displayed as a list with their number, title, and optional comments.

2. **The Script:**
   -  This is the JavaScript part that handles the logic and data.
   -  It uses Vuex to store and manage the list of people (akt√∏rer).
   -  It defines a `weeklyDocket` array to hold the meetings for the selected week.
   -  It fetches the initial data for meetings, people, and meeting types from the `/api/ugeplan` endpoint.
   -  It also fetches the list of people from `/api/actors`.
   -  The `fetchDocket` function is called when the filters are changed, updating the `weeklyDocket` array.
   -  The `formatDate` function formats the date string into a more readable format.

**In short, this component lets you:**

-  **Filter meetings:** Choose a week, a person, and specific meeting types.
-  **View the weekly docket:** See the list of meetings for the selected week, including details like date, time, location, and agenda items.

**Think of it like a personalized meeting planner that helps you stay organized and on top of your schedule!** 


## Explanation for `./pages/sager/list.vue`
Alright, let's break down this Vue component! It's like a little mini-app that displays a list of proposals (think bills or legislative suggestions). 

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **The View:** The `template` section is what the user sees. It's got three main parts:
    * **Filter Section:**  This lets the user filter the proposals by things like the period (like a legislative session), committee, politician, ministry, date, and a search term.
    * **Proposal List:** This is where the actual list of proposals is displayed.
    * **Pagination Controls:**  These buttons let the user navigate through multiple pages of proposals if there are too many to fit on one screen.

2. **The Logic:** The `script` section is where the magic happens. It's written in TypeScript, which is like JavaScript but with more structure. Here's what's going on:

    * **Data:**  The code sets up variables to store things like:
        * `currentPeriode`: The currently selected legislative period.
        * `searchQuery`: The user's search term.
        * `selectedCommittee`, `selectedPolitician`, `selectedMinistry`: The selected filters.
        * `selectedDate`: The selected date filter.
        * `lovforslag`:  An array to hold the list of proposals.
        * `pagination`:  Information about the current page and total pages.

    * **Fetching Data:**
        * `fetchPerioder`:  This function gets the list of available legislative periods.
        * `fetchLovforslag`: This function fetches the proposals from the server based on the current filters and page.  It uses `useAsyncData` to handle fetching data asynchronously.

    * **Updating the View:** The code uses `watch` to keep the list of proposals updated whenever the filters change. It also handles page changes using `changePage`.

    * **Initialization:**  The `onMounted` function runs when the component is first loaded. It fetches the periods and actors (committees, politicians, ministries) and sets up the initial list of proposals.

**In a nutshell, this component lets users filter and browse a list of proposals, making it easy to find the information they need.**
