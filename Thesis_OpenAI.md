### 3. Key Components:
- **Frontend**

## Explanation for `./app.vue`
Alright, let's break down what's happening in this `app.vue` file:

1. **Template Section**:
   - It's a Vue component that sets up the basic layout for a web page.
   - At the top, it includes a `HeaderMenu` component, which is likely the navigation or header section of the page.
   - There's a `<main>` section styled with a negative top margin (`-mt-32`), which might be for visual alignment purposes.
   - Inside `<main>`, there's a centered container with specific padding and maximum width (`max-w-7xl`), making sure the content doesn't stretch too wide.
   - The container has a background image (`gradient.jpg`) and a shadow effect, adding some visual flair.
   - The `NuxtPage` component is nested within the container, acting as a placeholder for dynamic page content, typical in Nuxt.js applications.

2. **Script Setup Section**:
   - It's using the `<script setup>` syntax, which is a more concise way to handle component scripts in Vue 3.
   - `useHead` is a Nuxt 3 composable function that manages the `<head>` section of the document.
   - It's setting classes for both the body and HTML elements, which affect the overall appearance. The body is set to full height (`h-full`), and the HTML uses a gradient background from light gray to a slightly darker gray.
   - The `lang` attribute of the HTML tag is set to "da" (Danish), indicating the language of the page.

Overall, this file is setting up a Vue component with a header, a main content area with a dynamic page component, and some styling for the page's appearance and language attributes. It's a pretty standard setup for a Nuxt.js application, focusing on layout and styling.

## Explanation for `./test.ts`
Sure thing! This TypeScript code is essentially fetching and displaying some data. Here's a quick breakdown:

1. **Imports:** It brings in two functions: `afstemningGet` and `createContext` from a file located at `./utils/oda`.

2. **Context Creation:** The `createContext()` function is called to create a context object, often used to store configurations or shared data that can be passed around.

3. **Data Fetching:** The `afstemningGet` function is then called with two arguments: the context (`ctx`) and an options object (`{ $top: 1 }`). This options object suggests that it's fetching some kind of list or collection, but only the top (or first) item.

4. **Promise Handling:** The `afstemningGet` function likely returns a Promise. The code uses `.then()` to handle this Promise, meaning once the data is successfully fetched, it logs the result (`afstemning`) to the console.

So, in a nutshell, the code sets up a context, fetches the first item from some data source using this context, and prints it out.

## Explanation for `./app.config.ts`
Alright, let's break it down! This code is exporting a default configuration for an application, likely in a TypeScript environment, given the file extension `.ts`. The `defineAppConfig` function is being used here, and it's taking an object as its argument.

Inside this object, there's a property called `ui` which stands for "user interface". Within this `ui` object, there are two properties being set: `primary` and `gray`. 

- `primary: 'green'` is probably setting the primary color of the UI to green. This is typically used for major elements like buttons, links, or headers that need to stand out.
  
- `gray: 'cool'` is setting some aspect of the gray color scheme to 'cool', which might refer to a cooler tone of gray, like those with a bluish undertone.

This configuration file is likely used to centrally manage the theme or style settings for the app's user interface, making it easy to update or change the appearance without digging through a bunch of CSS files.

## Explanation for `./tsconfig.script.json`
Alright, this file is named `tsconfig.script.json`, and it's all about configuring how TypeScript compiles your code. Think of it like a settings file for the TypeScript compiler.

Here's the lowdown on what each part does:

- **`target: "ES2018"`**: This tells TypeScript to compile your code down to ECMAScript 2018 standards. So, it's kinda like saying, "Hey, make sure the output is compatible with browsers or environments that understand ES2018."

- **`module: "commonjs"`**: This option specifies the module system to use. CommonJS is the module format Node.js uses, so it's setting things up for Node.js compatibility.

- **`strict: true`**: Enabling strict mode means TypeScript will be extra picky about your code. It turns on all strict type-checking options to catch potential errors early.

- **`esModuleInterop: true`**: This allows for better compatibility when importing CommonJS modules in an ES6-style, making it easier to work with both ES modules and CommonJS.

- **`skipLibCheck: true`**: This skips type-checking for all the declaration files (those `.d.ts` files). It can speed up the compilation, but you might miss errors in those files.

- **`forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true`**: This makes sure that file imports have consistent casing across your project. So, if you import a file with a different case, it'll throw an error, which is super helpful on case-sensitive file systems like Linux.

In essence, this configuration is setting up a TypeScript environment that's strict and Node.js-friendly, with a focus on catching errors early without being bogged down by library type checks. Cool, right?

## Explanation for `./nuxt.config.ts`
Alright, let's break this down! This file is a configuration file for a Nuxt 3 project, which is a framework for building Vue.js applications. Here's what each part does:

1. **Basic Setup**: The file uses `defineNuxtConfig` to export configuration options for the Nuxt app.

2. **App Head Configuration**: It sets up the head element of the app, specifically adding a link to a favicon (`/favicon.png`).

3. **TypeScript Settings**: It enables strict mode, which enforces stricter type checking for TypeScript, catching potential errors early.

11. **Runtime Configuration**: Sets up environment variables, specifically for `llmServiceUrl`, allowing for an external service URL to be configured through environment variables.

12. **Route Rules**: Configures a proxy for routes starting with `/llm/**`, redirecting them to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/**`. This is likely to handle API requests locally during development.

13. **Compatibility Date**: Sets a future date (`2024-08-17`) for compatibility checks, ensuring the code aligns with future Nuxt updates.

In short, this config file sets up various aspects of a Nuxt 3 application, including TypeScript, CSS, modules, plugins, and runtime configurations, ensuring the app is set up to use modern tools and practices efficiently.

## Explanation for `./tsconfig.json`
Sure thing! This `tsconfig.json` file is part of a TypeScript configuration setup for a project using Nuxt.js, which is a framework for building Vue.js applications. Here's the breakdown:

1. **File Purpose:** `tsconfig.json` is used to specify the TypeScript configuration for a project. It tells TypeScript how to compile the code.

2. **The "extends" Property:** The `"extends"` property means this `tsconfig.json` file is extending another configuration file, located at `./.nuxt/tsconfig.json`. This is a way to inherit settings from a base configuration, which helps keep things modular and organized.

3. **Nuxt.js Specific:** The comment at the top provides a link to the Nuxt.js documentation about TypeScript, suggesting that this setup is aligned with the Nuxt.js framework's recommendations for TypeScript usage.

In essence, this file is saying, "Hey, use the TypeScript settings defined in the `.nuxt/tsconfig.json` file for this project." This is pretty common in projects that use frameworks like Nuxt.js, which often provide their own configurations to streamline development.

## Explanation for `./eslint.config.js`
Alright, so this code is setting up ESLint configuration for a Nuxt.js project. Let's break it down:

1. **Import Statement**: It's using the `createConfigForNuxt` function from the `@nuxt/eslint-config/flat` package, which is likely a utility to help configure ESLint specifically for Nuxt.js environments.

2. **Rules Configuration**:
   - `'no-console': 'off'`: This turns off the rule that usually flags `console` statements as warnings or errors, so you can freely use `console.log` and friends.
   - `'vue/multi-word-component-names': 'off'`: Disables the rule that enforces component names to be multi-word. Useful if you have simple components with single-word names.
   - `'prettier/prettier': 'on'`: Ensures Prettier rules are applied, meaning your code style will be checked against Prettier's formatting guidelines.
   - `'@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any': 'off'`: Turns off the warning for using the `any` type in TypeScript, which some consider unsafe or bad practice.
   - `'@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars': 'off'`: Disables the rule that warns about variables that are declared but not used.

3. **Extends**: It extends configurations from `@nuxtjs/eslint-config-typescript` and `plugin:nuxt/recommended`, meaning it inherits a set of predefined rules and settings that are considered good practice for TypeScript and Nuxt.js projects.

4. **Files**: It specifies the files ESLint should check, in this case, any files with the extensions `.ts`, `.tsx`, or `.vue`.

5. **Ignores**: It lists patterns for files or directories to ignore during linting. Here, it's ignoring files that start with a dot (`**/.*`) and a specific file `utils/oda.ts`.

Overall, this configuration tailors ESLint to better suit a Nuxt.js project using TypeScript, with some relaxed rules to accommodate specific coding preferences or project needs.

## Explanation for `./drizzle.config.ts`
This code file is a configuration setup for connecting to a PostgreSQL database using a library called Drizzle. Here's a quick breakdown of what each part does:

1. **dotenv/config**: This line imports and loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, where the app can access them.

2. **defineConfig**: This function from Drizzle Kit is used to define the database configuration.

3. **dialect**: Specifies that the database type is PostgreSQL.

4. **out**: Indicates where the database-related files or generated code will be output, in this case, to the `./server/database` directory.

5. **schema**: Points to the TypeScript files that define the database schema, also located in the `./server/database` directory.

6. **dbCredentials**: This section sets up the connection details for the database:
   - `host`: The database server's hostname, defaulting to `localhost` if not specified in environment variables.
   - `port`: The port number, defaulting to `5432` (the default for PostgreSQL) if not specified.
   - `database`, `user`, `password`: These must be provided through environment variables (`DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`).

7. **verbose**: When set to `false`, limits the amount of logging or output during operations.

8. **ssl**: Set to `false`, meaning the connection does not use SSL.

9. **strict**: Set to `true`, enforcing strict mode, likely ensuring the database interactions adhere to stricter validation rules.

In summary, this file configures how your application connects to a PostgreSQL database, including specifying connection details, schema location, and some operational settings.

## Explanation for `./vitest.config.ts`
Alright, let's break it down! This code is a configuration file for Vitest, which is a testing framework often used in Vue.js projects, similar to Jest. The file is specifically set up for a Nuxt.js project.

Here's what's happening:

1. **Import Statement:** It imports `defineVitestConfig` from `@nuxt/test-utils/config`. This function is used to define configuration settings for Vitest in a way that's compatible with Nuxt.js.

2. **Export Default:** The `export default` statement is used to export the configuration object defined by `defineVitestConfig`. This makes the configuration available to the rest of the project.

3. **Configuration Object:** Inside `defineVitestConfig`, there's an empty object (`{}`). This is where you'd put any custom settings you want Vitest to use. It’s currently empty, so it's relying on default settings.

In essence, this file is a placeholder for configuring how Vitest runs tests in a Nuxt.js project. Right now, it doesn't do much because it lacks specific configuration, but it’s set up and ready for you to add custom settings as needed!

## Explanation for `./compare_document_types.py`
This script is designed to compare the content of PDF and HTML documents, primarily focusing on text and images. Here’s a quick breakdown of what it does:

1. **Extract Content**: 
   - It uses the PyMuPDF library to extract text and images from PDF files.
   - It uses BeautifulSoup to extract text and image sources from HTML files.

2. **Normalize and Compare Text**:
   - The script normalizes the text by making it lowercase, stripping extra spaces, and removing punctuation.
   - It compares the main content (the longest sentence) of both the PDF and HTML to see if they match.

3. **Compare Images**:
   - It creates MD5 hashes of images extracted from both document types to compare them.
   - It identifies images present in one type but missing in the other.

4. **Analyze Differences**:
   - The script analyzes and reports differences in text and images between matching PDF and HTML files.
   - It prints out the differences for each file and keeps track of the number of files with text differences or missing images.

5. **Usage**:
   - It looks in a specified directory (`assets/data/sagDocuments`) for subdirectories containing PDF and HTML files.
   - For each PDF file, it tries to find a corresponding HTML file and performs the comparison.

6. **Report**:
   - Finally, it summarizes the comparison results, including the number of files checked and the percentage of files with differences in text or missing images.

Overall, it's a handy utility for ensuring consistency between PDF and HTML versions of documents, particularly useful in environments where documents are published in multiple formats.

## Explanation for `./document_parser.py`
This Python script is like a digital librarian for HTML documents. It reads HTML files, cleans up the text by removing unnecessary parts (like headers and footers), and then processes the cleaned content to generate embeddings—basically, turning the text into a format that a machine learning model can understand.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Environment Setup**: It loads environment variables (like database credentials) using `dotenv`.

2. **Database Connection**: The `get_db_connection` function connects to a PostgreSQL database using credentials from environment variables.

3. **Text Cleaning**: The `extract_main_content` function scrubs the text, removing lines that match certain patterns (like page numbers, headers, or specific unwanted phrases).

4. **Document Processing**: The `process_document` function checks if a document has been processed before by looking it up in the database. If not, it reads the content, cleans it, and sends it to a FastAPI service (running locally) to generate an embedding. The result, along with metadata, is stored in the database.

5. **Asynchronous Tasks**: The `process_documents` function walks through a specified directory, finds HTML files, and creates asynchronous tasks to process each document concurrently.

6. **Execution**: When run directly, it processes all HTML files in the `assets/data/html` directory.

So, this script is essentially a document processor that uses asynchronous programming to efficiently handle multiple files, clean them up, and store useful data in a database for further use or analysis. It's like a neat little assembly line for document management!

## Explanation for `./middleware/redirects.global.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code does:

1. **Purpose**: This file is part of a middleware setup in a Nuxt.js application. Middleware functions are used to run custom logic before navigating to a route.

2. **Elections Array**: There's an array called `elections` containing paths that presumably represent past election data.

3. **Route Middleware**: The `defineNuxtRouteMiddleware` function is exported as the default, meaning it's a middleware that executes during routing.

4. **Redirect Logic**: When a user tries to navigate to any of the paths listed in the `elections` array, the middleware kicks in. If the requested path matches one in the array, the user is redirected to the path `/folketingsvalg-2022-valgtest`.

5. **Redirect Code**: The `navigateTo` function is used with a `{ redirectCode: 301 }`, which is an HTTP status code indicating a permanent redirect. This tells the browser (and search engines) that the requested page has moved permanently.

In short, this middleware ensures that if anyone tries to access the pages for older elections, they are seamlessly redirected to the 2022 election test page.

## Explanation for `./types/actors.ts`
Alright, let's break this down! The code is a TypeScript file defining some interfaces and a type related to "actors" in a system, likely representing entities in some organizational or political context.

1. **Import Statement:** 
   - It imports a type called `Aktør` from another file called `aktør`. This means `BaseActor` and any interface extending it will include whatever fields or methods are defined in `Aktør`.

2. **BaseActor Interface:** 
   - This is an interface that extends `Aktør` and adds three properties: `id` (a number), `navn` (a string, probably the name), and `type` (a string indicating the actor type).

3. **Specific Actor Interfaces:**
   - **Committee:** Extends `BaseActor` and fixes the `type` property to the string `'Udvalg'`, which is Danish for "committee".
   - **Politician:** Extends `BaseActor` and has the `type` set to `'Person'`.
   - **Ministry:** Extends `BaseActor` with the `type` set to `'Ministerium'`, which is Danish for "ministry".

4. **Actor Type:** 
   - This is a union type, meaning an `Actor` can be any one of the three interfaces: `Committee`, `Politician`, or `Ministry`.

In summary, the code structure is setting up a system to categorize different kinds of actors (like committees, politicians, and ministries) with shared and specific properties. It helps ensure that when you work with these entities in your code, they have consistent and expected properties.

## Explanation for `./types/meeting.ts`
This TypeScript code file is defining types for a project that uses a library called `drizzle-orm` to handle database operations. The file is in the `./types` directory, which suggests it's primarily for defining and organizing types used throughout the application.

Here's a breakdown of what each line is doing:

1. **Imports**: 
   - `InferSelectModel` is imported from `drizzle-orm`. This is likely a utility type that infers the TypeScript type of a database model based on some schema.
   - A wildcard import (`* as schema`) is used to import everything from the `../server/database/schema` module. This module probably contains definitions for the database schema, which are used to generate the types.

2. **Type Definitions**:
   - `Meeting`: This type is inferred from `schema.møde`, which probably represents a "meeting" table or entity in the database schema.
   - `MeetingType`: This is inferred from `schema.mødetype`, likely corresponding to a "meeting type" table or entity.
   - `MeetingAktør`: This is inferred from `schema.mødeAktør`, probably representing a "meeting actor" or participant entity.

In essence, this file is setting up TypeScript types that map to specific database entities, allowing you to use these types throughout your application for type-safe database operations. This way, you can ensure that your code aligns with the database structure, reducing the chance of runtime errors.

## Explanation for `./types/aktør.ts`
Alright, let’s break it down! This TypeScript file is all about defining types for a database model, using a library called `drizzle-orm`.

Here's what's happening:

1. **Imports**: It imports `InferSelectModel` from `drizzle-orm`. This is a utility that helps define types based on your database schema. It also imports everything from a schema file located at `../server/database/schema`.

2. **Type Definitions**: The file defines several TypeScript types using `InferSelectModel`. Each type corresponds to a specific table or entity in the database schema:
   - `Aktør`: Represents the type for the `aktør` table or entity.
   - `AktørType`: Represents the type for the `aktørtype` table or entity.
   - `AktørAktørRolle`: Represents the type for the `sagAktørRolle` table or entity.
   - `AktørAktør`: Represents the type for the `aktørAktør` table or entity.

In essence, this file is setting up TypeScript types to ensure that when you interact with these tables in your code, you're doing so with the correct structure as defined by the database schema. It helps with type safety and reduces errors when querying or manipulating database records.

## Explanation for `./types/sag.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this TypeScript file is doing!

1. **Imports**: It's importing types from a library called `drizzle-orm` and a database schema from a relative path. The `InferSelectModel` is likely a utility that helps generate TypeScript types based on the schema definitions.

2. **Base Types**: The file defines a bunch of TypeScript types (`Sag`, `Sagstrin`, `Dagsordenspunkt`, etc.) using `InferSelectModel` to infer the structure of these types from the database schema. These represent the basic entities in your database, like cases (`Sag`), case steps (`Sagstrin`), agenda items (`Dagsordenspunkt`), actors (`Aktør`), and so on.

3. **Extended Types**: It then defines interfaces like `SagstrinWithRelations`, `DokumentWithRelations`, and others that extend these base types to include relationships between entities. For instance, `SagstrinWithRelations` includes an array of `Dagsordenspunkt` and a nested structure for related actors and their roles.

4. **Complex Relations**: The `SagWithRelations` interface is a more comprehensive structure that combines all these relationships into a single type. It represents a case (`Sag`) with all its related steps, documents, and actors, each with their specific roles and connections.

5. **API Response Type**: The `SagApiResponse` type defines what the API might return: either a successful response containing a `SagWithRelations`, or an error message.

6. **Detailed View**: `SagDetails` is a type that offers a detailed view of a case, including its related actors, documents, and speech segments (`TaleSegment`).

In essence, this file is setting up a robust type system to handle complex data structures and relationships in a TypeScript application, making it easier to work with data that involves multiple interconnected tables or entities. It's like setting up a map for navigating through a complex web of data!

## Explanation for `./composables/api.ts`
Sure thing! This code is essentially creating and exporting two things related to some sort of feeds, probably for an application that deals with legislative proposals, cases, and votes.

1. **`feedsInfo`**: This is an object that holds information about different types of feeds. Each feed (like `lovforslag`, `sag`, and `afstemning`) has a `title` (which is a descriptive name) and `pages` (likely representing the number of pages or sections available for each feed).

2. **`validFeeds`**: This is an array generated by using `Object.keys(feedsInfo)`, which extracts the keys from the `feedsInfo` object. So, `validFeeds` will contain `['lovforslag', 'sag', 'afstemning']`, listing all the types of feeds available.

In simple terms, this code is organizing some data about different feeds and making it easy to access or validate which feeds are available in the application.

## Explanation for `./composables/useCurrentPeriode.ts`
Alright, let’s break down what this code is doing in a nutshell:

1. **Purpose**: This file defines a composable function `useCurrentPeriode` which helps manage and interact with "periods" (which are likely some kind of time-related data entities) in a Vue.js or Nuxt.js application using Pinia, a state management library.

2. **Imports**:
   - `useMetaStore`: This is a Pinia store that likely holds data related to metadata, including these "periods."
   - `storeToRefs`: This utility helps you work with reactive references from the store.

3. **Functionality**:
   - **Reactive References**: It extracts reactive references `perioder` and `currentPeriode` from the meta store.
   - **fetchPerioder**: An asynchronous function that:
     - Checks if the `perioder` list is empty.
     - If empty, it fetches data from an API endpoint (`/api/perioder`) and updates the store with this data.
     - Sets the first period from the fetched data as the current period using `setCurrentPeriode`.
   - **setCurrentPeriode**: A function to update the current period in the store. It:
     - Sets the current period to `null` if the given `periodeId` is `null`.
     - Otherwise, finds a period by `id` and sets it as the current period in the store if it exists.

4. **Return**: The `useCurrentPeriode` function returns an object containing `perioder`, `currentPeriode`, `fetchPerioder`, and `setCurrentPeriode`, allowing other parts of the application to access these references and methods.

In short, this file is all about managing the current "period" by fetching period data from an API and setting the active period within the application's state management system.

## Explanation for `./composables/useSagDocuments.ts`
This code is a Vue composable function named `useSagDocuments` that helps manage the fetching and state of a list of documents associated with a given `sagId`. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. **Document Interface**: Defines the structure of a document object, including properties like `id`, `titel` (yes, it's spelled like that), `content`, `htmlUrl`, `filurl`, and `format`.

2. **Reactive State**: Uses Vue's `ref` to create reactive references for:
   - `documents`: An array to store the documents fetched from the API.
   - `isLoading`: A boolean indicating whether the fetch operation is in progress.
   - `error`: A string to capture any error message that occurs during the fetch process.

3. **fetchDocuments Function**: An asynchronous function that:
   - Sets `isLoading` to `true` and clears any existing error.
   - Attempts to fetch documents using a hypothetical `useFetch` function. It's assumed this function takes a URL and query parameters, like `sagId`, and returns a promise with a `data` object.
   - On success, updates the `documents` array with the fetched data.
   - On failure, sets an error message and logs the error to the console.
   - Finally, it sets `isLoading` to `false` to indicate the operation is complete.

4. **Returned Object**: Provides access to the `documents`, `isLoading`, `error`, and `fetchDocuments` function, making them available for use in a Vue component.

Essentially, this composable abstracts away the logic for fetching and managing document data, making it easy to integrate into Vue components that need to display or interact with these documents.

## Explanation for `./composables/useAktorer.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code does in a simple way:

1. **Imports and Setup**: The code starts by importing a few things:
   - `useQuery` from `@tanstack/vue-query` for handling data fetching.
   - `useAktørStore` from a local store to manage state using Pinia.
   - Types for `Actor` from a types directory to keep the code type-safe.

2. **Interface Definition**: It defines an interface `AktørQueryParams` that lists possible parameters you can use to filter or search actors (`sagId`, `periodId`, `aktørType`, `rolle`, and `searchTerm`).

3. **Main Function**: The function `useAktorer` is the main event here. It takes an optional object `params` based on `AktørQueryParams` to customize your query.

4. **Data Fetching**:
   - It defines an async function `getAktører` to fetch actor data from the `/api/actors` endpoint using the provided parameters. It constructs a query string with these parameters.
   - The fetch uses `$fetch`, which is likely a wrapper around `fetch` for making HTTP requests.

5. **Query Management**:
   - `useQuery` is used to handle the fetching logic. It manages the fetching state, caching, and other query-related operations. It returns `data`, `isLoading`, `error`, and `refetch`.

6. **State Management**:
   - It uses Vue's `watch` function to observe changes to the `data`. When the data changes, it updates the `aktørStore` with the new data using `setAktører`.

7. **Return Object**:
   - The function returns an object containing:
     - `aktører`: A computed property that always returns the latest list of actors or an empty array if there's no data.
     - `isLoading`: A boolean indicating if the data is currently being loaded.
     - `error`: Any error that might have occurred during the fetch.
     - `refetch`: A function to manually re-trigger the data fetch.

In a nutshell, this file provides a way to fetch and manage a list of actors from an API, with options to filter the results and automatically update a local store when new data is fetched. It's like a smart, reactive hook for handling actors' data in a Vue app!

## Explanation for `./llm_service/main.py`
Alright, so this code file is setting up a web service using FastAPI that works with Danish text processing. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. **Setup and Libraries**: The script uses FastAPI to create a web server, and it employs various libraries like `transformers` for NLP tasks, `torch` for tensor computations, and `nltk` for handling stopwords in Danish.

2. **Stopwords**: It downloads Danish stopwords using `nltk` and also defines some extra stopwords related to the Danish parliament.

3. **Model Loading**: The script loads a pre-trained Danish BERT model for NLP tasks, specifically for generating embeddings of text.

4. **Preprocessing**: There's a function to preprocess Danish text by converting it to lowercase, removing HTML tags, and managing whitespace. (Note: Some preprocessing steps are commented out, like removing special characters and stopwords.)

5. **Chunking**: There’s a function to split text into chunks, which can be necessary for handling large documents in manageable pieces.

6. **API Endpoints**: 
   - `/process_document_embeddings`: Accepts a document, splits it into chunks, generates embeddings for each chunk using the BERT model, and returns these embeddings.
   - `/get_embedding`: Takes a text string, preprocesses it, and returns an embedding for the text.
   - `/generate_question`: Uses an LLM model named "Ministral-8B" to generate a question based on the input Danish text.
   - `/health`: A simple health check endpoint to ensure the service is running.

7. **CORS Middleware**: Configures the app to allow requests from specified origins, which is useful for web applications interacting with this API.

8. **Running the Server**: If executed directly, it runs the FastAPI app using `uvicorn`, listening on port 8000.

In essence, this code creates a service that processes Danish text by splitting it, generating embeddings, and even formulating questions, making use of pre-trained language models. It's like a mini AI server for handling Danish language tasks!

## Explanation for `./config/xml_comparer.py`
Alright, let's break down what this Python script does:

1. **Extract XML Structure:** The script starts by defining a function, `extract_structure`, that takes an XML file, parses it using `xml.etree.ElementTree`, and then builds a nested dictionary structure representing the hierarchy and attributes of the XML elements. This is done recursively by traversing each node.

2. **Compare XML Structures:** Another function, `compare_structures`, is defined to compare the structures of multiple XML files. It gathers paths (tags) from each structure and compares them, storing the results in a dictionary where each key is a unique path, and values are lists of attributes from each XML file.

3. **Load XML Files:** The script uses `glob` to find all XML files located in the `assets/data/meetings` directory, including subdirectories. The files are sorted to ensure consistent processing order.

4. **Extract Metadata Structure:** A function `extract_metadata_structure` is defined to parse a specific XML file, `metadata.xml`. It extracts EntityType information along with its properties and navigation properties, using namespaces to correctly parse elements.

5. **Map XML Structure to Metadata:** The script defines `map_to_metadata`, which maps the previously extracted XML structures to the metadata structure. This involves matching XML paths to entity names and attaching corresponding metadata.

6. **Compare Mapped Structures:** The function `compare_mapped_structures` compares these mapped structures to see how each XML file aligns with the metadata definitions. It tracks which entities and attributes are present or missing across the files.

7. **Save Comparison Results:** Finally, the comparison results are saved to a file named `comparison_result.txt`. The script writes each entity's information, showing which files contain the entity and detailing their attributes and metadata properties.

Overall, the script's main goal is to compare XML files against a metadata standard to ensure consistency and document any discrepancies in their structure. This can be super useful for data validation in environments where XML data must adhere to a predefined schema.

## Explanation for `./config/rename_postgres.py`
This Python script connects to a PostgreSQL database and renames tables and columns by replacing specific special characters. Here's a quick rundown of what it does:

1. **Character Mapping**: It defines a mapping (`char_map`) to replace special characters: `æ` becomes `ae`, `ø` becomes `oe`, and `å` becomes `aa`.

2. **Database Connection**: It connects to a PostgreSQL database named "oda" using the `psycopg2` library with the specified credentials.

3. **Fetching Tables**: It retrieves all table names from the database's information schema.

4. **Table Renaming**: For each table name, it checks for the special characters defined in `char_map`. If any are found, it replaces them and renames the table.

5. **Fetching Columns**: After renaming a table, it fetches all the column names for the newly named table.

6. **Column Renaming**: Similarly, it checks each column name for the special characters, replaces them if necessary, and renames the columns.

7. **Database Update**: After processing all tables and columns, it commits the changes to the database and closes the connection.

Overall, the script helps in standardizing table and column names by removing specific special characters, making them more compatible with systems that may not support such characters.

## Explanation for `./config/download_oda_bak.py`
Alright, let's break down what this Python script is doing:

1. **Imports the requests library**: This is a popular library for making HTTP requests in Python. It's like a Swiss Army knife for fetching web content.

2. **Sets up the URL and credentials**: The `url` points to a file named `oda.bak` hosted at a specific web address. To access this file, the script uses basic authentication with a `username` and `password`.

3. **Makes an HTTP GET request**: Using `requests.get()`, the script sends a GET request to the URL, passing the `username` and `password` for authentication. It’s like knocking on the door of the server and showing your access card.

4. **Saves the response content**: Once the server responds, the script opens (or creates) a file named `oda.bak` in write-binary mode (`"wb"`). It then writes the content from the server's response into this file.

So, in a nutshell, this script downloads a file from a web server using HTTP authentication and saves it locally as `oda.bak`. It's like a mini downloader that fetches a backup file from a remote server.

## Explanation for `./config/parse_meetings.py`
This Python script is all about parsing XML files to extract data about parliamentary meetings. Let's break it down:

1. **Imports and Setup**: The script uses the `lxml` library for XML parsing, alongside modules like `os` and `glob` for file handling. It also leverages `defaultdict` from `collections` for organizing data.

2. **`parse_speaker_data` Function**: This function takes in metadata about a speaker and extracts relevant information such as the speaker's name, role, group, and title. It's designed to handle XML data specifically and relies on XPath queries to get the required details.

3. **`parse_meeting_xml` Function**: This is where the heavy lifting happens. It parses a single XML file representing a meeting. The function:
   - Extracts metadata about the meeting (like session information, date, and meeting number).
   - Extracts agenda items and their related details, such as case numbers and titles.
   - Collects speeches associated with each agenda item, using the `parse_speaker_data` function to get speaker-specific info. It also captures speech content and metadata like modification times.

4. **`parse_all_meetings` Function**: This function scans a specific directory for XML files and processes each using `parse_meeting_xml`. It stores the resulting data in a dictionary, where keys are derived from filenames, sans extensions and specific suffixes.

5. **Execution**: Finally, the script calls `parse_all_meetings` and stores the resulting dictionary in `parsed_meetings`. This dictionary contains all the parsed data from the XML files, organized by meeting.

In essence, this script automates the extraction and structuring of parliamentary meeting data from XML files, making it easier to analyze or use elsewhere.

## Explanation for `./config/analyse_meeting_xml.py`
This Python script is designed to analyze the structure and content of an XML file, likely related to some form of meeting minutes or parliamentary documents. Let's break down what it does:

1. **XML Parsing**: The function `analyze_xml_structure` takes an XML file path as input. It uses Python's `xml.etree.ElementTree` (ET) to parse the XML file and obtain the root element.

2. **Printing XML Structure**: Inside the function, there's a nested function `print_structure` that recursively traverses the XML elements. It prints the tag names of each element, and if an element has an attribute named `tingdokID`, it includes that in the output. This part helps in visualizing the hierarchy and structure of the XML file.

3. **Data Analysis**: Another nested function, `analyze_data`, also recursively processes the XML elements. It collects text content and `tingdokID` attributes, storing them in a dictionary (`data`) using paths as keys. This part is responsible for gathering information about the data within the XML.

4. **Analysis Report (Commented Out)**: There is a section (currently commented out) that would write the XML structure and data analysis to a file named "meeting_minutes_analysis.txt". It would include:
   - The XML structure as printed by `print_structure`.
   - A summary of how many unique values are present for each path in the XML and sample values.
   - Potential mappings of XML paths to a Prisma schema, which suggests how XML data could relate to database models and fields (like "Periode", "Moede", "Aktoer", etc.).

5. **Prisma Schema Mapping**: There's a dictionary `xml_to_prisma_mapping` that maps specific XML paths to Prisma model fields. This mapping implies which XML elements could correspond to database entries, hinting at integration with a Prisma-backed database.

6. **Usage**: The script seems to be set up for a specific XML file located at "assets/data/meetings/20222/20222_M21_helemoedet.xml". The commented-out usage section suggests how the function might be executed.

The overall purpose of this script is to help developers or analysts understand the XML file's structure and content, and possibly prepare for database integration. However, the commented-out sections indicate that writing results to a file is optional or under development.

## Explanation for `./plugins/vue-query.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code is doing in a fun and simple way!

This TypeScript file is a plugin for a Nuxt.js application, and it's all about integrating Vue Query, a data-fetching library, into the app.

Here's the play-by-play:

1. **Import Magic:** The file starts by importing necessary types and functions from the `@tanstack/vue-query` library, which is like the toolkit for managing server state in Vue apps.

2. **Defining the Plugin:** It uses `defineNuxtPlugin` to create a Nuxt plugin. This is like telling Nuxt, "Hey, I have some extra stuff I want to add to the app."

3. **Managing State:** It defines a state variable `vueQueryState` to hold the dehydrated state of queries. Think of it as a snapshot of your server data that you can store and retrieve.

4. **Query Client Setup:** It creates a `QueryClient` with some default options:
   - `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` means it won't automatically refetch data when you focus back on the window. So, less annoying refreshes!
   - `staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5` sets data to be considered fresh for 5 minutes. Fresh data is good data!

5. **Plugin Options:** Packs the `queryClient` into options to be used with the Vue Query Plugin.

6. **Using the Plugin:** Integrates Vue Query into the Vue app by telling Nuxt to use `VueQueryPlugin` with the specified options. This makes Vue Query features available throughout the app.

7. **Server-Side Handling:** If the code is running on the server, it listens for the `app:rendered` event. When the app is done rendering, it dehydrates the query client's state and saves it to `vueQueryState`. This prepares the state to be shipped to the client.

8. **Client-Side Handling:** If the code is running on the client, it listens for the `app:created` event and hydrates the query client with the state stored in `vueQueryState`. This is like giving the client a jumpstart with server-fetched data.

In short, this plugin smoothly handles data fetching and caching with Vue Query, making sure your app is efficient and ready to go whether it's running on the server or client. Pretty neat, huh?

## Explanation for `./plugins/init.server.ts`
Alright, so you've got a Nuxt.js plugin file here. Nuxt.js is a framework based on Vue.js that's great for building server-side rendered applications.

The code inside `init.server.ts` is exporting a default function using `defineNuxtPlugin`. This is a special helper in Nuxt that lets you create plugins, which are basically ways to extend the functionality of your Nuxt app.

Here's what's happening in this specific file:

1. **`defineNuxtPlugin`:** This function is used to define a Nuxt plugin. It takes a function as an argument, and you can use this function to hook into various parts of the Nuxt lifecycle or add global functionality.

2. **Function Body:** Right now, your function is empty. There's a commented-out line (`console.info('init server');`). If you were to uncomment it, it would log "init server" to the console whenever the server initializes this plugin. This is useful for debugging or confirming that your plugin is being loaded properly.

In short, this file is setting up a Nuxt server-side plugin, but it's not doing anything yet because the main action (logging to the console) is commented out. Once you uncomment the `console.info` line, you'll get a simple log indicating the plugin's initialization.

## Explanation for `./plugins/device.ts`
This code is a Nuxt.js plugin designed to detect if a user is visiting the website from a mobile device. Here's a quick breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Regular Expressions for Mobile Detection**: It defines two regular expressions, `REGEX_MOBILE1` and `REGEX_MOBILE2`. These regex patterns match common terms and identifiers found in mobile device user agent strings. `REGEX_MOBILE1` targets a wide range of mobile device identifiers, while `REGEX_MOBILE2` focuses on a shorter prefix of mobile user agents.

2. **Mobile Detection Function**: The `isMobile` function takes a `userAgent` string as input and determines if it matches either of the regex patterns, indicating the user is on a mobile device.

3. **User Agent Retrieval**: The code tries to obtain the user agent string. It first attempts to fetch it from request headers via `useRequestHeaders()`. If that doesn't work (like during client-side execution), it defaults to using `navigator.userAgent`.

4. **Plugin Provision**: The plugin provides a utility within the Nuxt application context. Specifically, it exposes the `isMobile` function, which can be used elsewhere in the app to check if the current user is on a mobile device.

So, whenever you need to know if a visitor is using a mobile device, this plugin has your back!

## Explanation for `./tests/server/oda/scheduler.test.ts`
This TypeScript test file is using the `vitest` testing framework to check the functionality of a scheduler in a server module. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the file does:

1. **Imports:** The file imports necessary functions and utilities from `vitest` (like `describe`, `it`, `expect`, and `vi`) for structuring and asserting tests. It also imports the `setup` function from `@nuxt/test-utils/e2e` for setting up the test environment and two functions `startSyncScheduler` and `runManualSync` from the scheduler module.

2. **Test Suite:** 
   - The whole suite is named 'ODA Scheduler Tests', which indicates it is testing the scheduler functionalities of an ODA (which stands for something specific in your context, like Open Data API or something similar).

3. **Setup:** It uses the `setup` function to configure the test environment, though specific options are not provided in the snippet.

4. **Individual Tests:**
   - **Test 1:** Checks that `startSyncScheduler` can be called without throwing any errors. This ensures the scheduler can start without issues.
   - **Test 2:** Asynchronously checks that `runManualSync` can be executed without throwing errors, verifying that manual synchronization can be triggered correctly.
   - **Test 3:** Uses `vi.useFakeTimers()` to simulate and control time in the test environment. It spies on `setInterval` to ensure that the `startSyncScheduler` sets up a recurring task. The test then advances the simulated time by one hour and checks that the `setInterval` function was called correctly.

5. **Timers and Spies:** The file uses fake timers to control time-based functionality and a spy to monitor how often a function is called, which is useful for testing scheduled tasks.

Overall, this test file ensures that the scheduler for the ODA runs without errors and behaves correctly over time.

## Explanation for `./tests/server/oda/sync.test.ts`
This code file is a test suite for syncing various entities within a server-side ODA (probably some kind of data architecture or system) using the `vitest` testing framework. Let's break it down:

- **Imports**: It brings in necessary functions and utilities from `vitest` for testing (`describe`, `it`, `expect`), a setup function from `@nuxt/test-utils/e2e`, and several sync functions from paths like `../../../server/oda/syncEntities`.

- **Test Suite Declaration**: Using `describe`, it sets up a suite called "ODA Sync Tests". This suite is likely for testing the synchronization capabilities of various entities.

- **Setup**: The `setup` function is called to configure the testing environment, although the specific options are not provided in the snippet.

- **Helper Function**: `testIndividualSync` is a helper function that simplifies writing tests for each sync function. It takes a sync function and a name, then creates a test case to check if the sync function executes without throwing errors.

- **Individual Sync Tests**: The code uses the helper function to set up tests for several entities like 'Aktør', 'Afstemning', 'Dokument', and others. Each test ensures the corresponding sync function completes successfully.

- **All Entities Sync Test**: There is a test that checks if `syncAllEntities()` can sync everything without errors.

In a nutshell, the file ensures that syncing individual entities and all entities together works as expected without causing any exceptions.

## Explanation for `./tests/e2e/index.ts`
Sure thing! The file path `./tests/e2e/index.ts` suggests that this file is part of an end-to-end (E2E) testing setup for an application. E2E tests are designed to simulate real user scenarios to ensure that the entire application flow works as expected.

Here's a breakdown of what such a file might do:

1. **Imports and Setup**: It likely starts by importing necessary libraries and tools. Common libraries for E2E testing include Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright, which help automate browser actions.

2. **Test Scenarios**: The file will define one or more test scenarios, typically using a testing framework like Mocha, Jasmine, or Jest. Each test case will outline a sequence of user actions, such as navigating to a page, clicking buttons, entering data, etc.

3. **Assertions**: It will include assertions to verify that the app behaves as expected. For instance, after a user action, the test might check that the correct content appears on the page or that a certain API call returns the expected data.

4. **Teardown**: At the end, there might be cleanup code to reset the testing environment, ensuring that each test runs independently without interference from others.

To get more specific details, you'd need to look at the actual code inside the file, but this should give you a general idea of its purpose within an E2E testing suite!

## Explanation for `./stores/meta.ts`
Alright, let’s break this down!

This code is defining a store using Pinia, which is a state management library for Vue.js applications. Think of it like a way to centrally manage data that your app might need to access from different components.

Here's what each part does:

1. **Periode Interface**: This defines a structure (or shape) for `Periode` objects, which have three properties: `id` (a number), `titel` (a string), and `slutdato` (a string). This helps TypeScript know what kind of data to expect.

2. **useMetaStore Store**: This is the main store being defined. It's called `useMetaStore` and it’s identified by the name 'meta'.

3. **State**: This part initializes two pieces of state:
   - `perioder`: An array of `Periode` objects. Initially, it's empty.
   - `currentPeriode`: This holds a single `Periode` object or `null` if there isn't one set. It starts off as `null`.

4. **Actions**: These are functions to modify the store's state:
   - `setPerioder(perioder: Periode[])`: This function updates the `perioder` array with a new array of `Periode` objects.
   - `setCurrentPeriode(periode: Periode | null)`: This updates `currentPeriode` with a new `Periode` object or sets it to `null`.

Basically, this file sets up a store to manage periods of time (each with an ID, title, and end date) and allows you to set or update a list of periods and the currently active period. It's super handy for managing these specific pieces of data across different parts of a Vue app!

## Explanation for `./stores/main.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this TypeScript code is doing in a fun and easy way!

This file is part of a Vue.js application, and it's using Pinia, which is a state management library. Think of Pinia like a tool that helps different parts of your app talk to each other and share data easily.

1. **Defining a Store:** The code uses `defineStore` from Pinia to create a store named `'main'`. You can think of a store like a central place where your app keeps certain pieces of information that might need to be accessed or changed by different components.

2. **State:** In this store, there's a `state` function that returns an object. This object has a property called `headerTitle`, which is initially set to the string `'Parlamentet.dk – deltagende demokrati'`. The state is like the memory of your app; it remembers what the current `headerTitle` is.

3. **Actions:** The `actions` object contains methods that can change the state. Here, there's one action called `updateHeaderTitle`. This method takes a `title` as an argument (which should be a string) and updates the `headerTitle` in the state with this new title.

In short, this code is setting up a central place in a Vue app to store and update the title of a header, which presumably is displayed somewhere in the app. The title starts with a default text but can be changed by calling the `updateHeaderTitle` method with a new title. This makes it easy to keep the title consistent across the application!

## Explanation for `./stores/electionQuiz.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code is doing! This file is using Pinia, a state management library for Vue.js, to create a store named `electionQuiz`. Here's a quick overview of its components:

1. **Data Import**: The file imports election-related data from two JSON files, `electionData.json` and `metaData.json`. These are likely located in the project's `assets/data` directory.

2. **Interfaces**: 
   - `Party`: Defines the structure of a political party object with properties like initials, color, logo, agreements, disagreements, and an optional title.
   - `IObjectKeys`: A generic interface allowing objects with dynamic string keys pointing to string or string array values.
   - `Election`: Extends `IObjectKeys` to define election-related data, including fields like `ftid`, `samling`, `link`, `title`, and arrays for `yay`, `nay`, and `absent_or_maybe` responses, along with an answer field.

3. **Utility Function**:
   - `shuffleArray`: A function to randomly shuffle arrays of `Party` or `Election` objects. It's used to randomize the order of the quiz and parties for a more dynamic experience.

4. **Pinia Store (`useElectionQuizStore`)**:
   - **State**: 
     - `quiz`: Holds a shuffled array of election data.
     - `step`: Tracks the current step in the quiz.
     - `parties`: Holds a shuffled array of party details.
     - `hasScrolled`: A boolean tracking whether the user has scrolled, possibly for UI purposes.

   - **Actions**:
     - `reply(answer)`: Records an answer for the current quiz step and moves to the next step if it's not the last one.
     - `nextStep()`: Simply increments the step count.
     - `previousStep()`: Decrements the step count.
     - `setScroll(val)`: Sets the `hasScrolled` state to the provided boolean value.

   - **Getters**:
     - `quizResult`: Processes the quiz data to calculate how many agreements and disagreements each party has based on the user's answers.
     - `sortedQuizResult`: Sorts the parties based on their agreement-to-disagreement ratio, providing a ranking of parties according to how closely they align with the user's quiz answers.

In essence, this file sets up a quiz related to elections where users can answer questions, and the app calculates which political party aligns most with the user's responses. The results are dynamically sorted and ready to be displayed to the user. This is a neat way to help users understand their political alignment based on their views!

## Explanation for `./stores/aktør.ts`
Alright, let's break down this code:

This file is setting up a store using Pinia, which is a state management library for Vue.js. It's like a central hub where you can keep track of certain data across your app. Here's what each part is doing:

1. **Imports:** It brings in `defineStore` from Pinia. This function is used to create a new store.

2. **Interface Aktør:** This defines a TypeScript interface for an `Aktør` object, which includes an `id` (a number) and a `navn` (a string). Think of it as a blueprint for what an `Aktør` should look like.

3. **Define Store:** The `useAktørStore` is the name of the store being created. It manages data related to "aktører," which is probably some kind of entity in the app (maybe "actors" in English?).

4. **State:** 
   - `aktører`: Starts as an empty array that will hold multiple `Aktør` objects.
   - `selectedAktør`: Starts as `null` and will hold a single `Aktør` object that is selected.

5. **Actions:** 
   - `setAktører`: This function updates the `aktører` array with a new array of `Aktør` objects.
   - `setSelectedAktør`: This function updates which `Aktør` is currently selected.

Overall, this store provides a way to manage and interact with a list of "aktører" within a Vue.js application, allowing you to set and select these entities easily.

## Explanation for `./stores/sag.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this TypeScript code is doing.

First off, it's using Pinia, which is a state management library for Vue.js, similar to Vuex but lighter and more modern.

1. **Interface Definition (`Sag`)**: The code defines a TypeScript interface called `Sag`. This interface outlines the structure of an object that represents some sort of entity (maybe a case or item) with various properties like `id`, `titel`, `typeid`, etc. These properties are mostly nullable, meaning they can be `null` or hold a value, which provides flexibility in handling incomplete data.

2. **Store Definition (`useSagStore`)**: The `useSagStore` is a Pinia store, essentially a centralized place to manage the state of `Sag` objects within a Vue application.

   - **State**: The `state` is a function that initializes the state of the store. Here, it starts with `sag` set to `null`, meaning there's no `Sag` object data loaded initially.

   - **Actions**: The `actions` section defines methods to modify the state. In this case, there’s one action, `setSag`, which takes a `Sag` object and updates the `sag` state with it. This is useful for when you want to load or update the `Sag` data in your application.

So, in summary, this file sets up a Pinia store to manage a `Sag` object in a Vue.js app. It allows you to define the shape of a `Sag`, hold its state, and update it using the `setSag` action. This setup is handy for managing and sharing data across different components in a Vue app.

## Explanation for `./server/database/schema.ts`
Alright, so this code file is setting up a bunch of database table schemas using a library called `drizzle-orm`, specifically for PostgreSQL. Each `pgTable` function defines a table with its columns and their types, constraints, and relationships to other tables. Here’s a quick rundown of what’s happening:

1. **Tables Definition**: There are a ton of tables being defined here, like `synclogger`, `afstemning`, `aktør`, `dokument`, `møde`, `sag`, etc. Each table has columns with specific data types like `text`, `integer`, `boolean`, `timestamp`, and even `vector` for embeddings, which is pretty fancy for storing things like machine learning model outputs.

2. **Relationships**: Many tables have foreign key relationships, which are set up using `.references(() => otherTable.id)`. This is like saying, "Hey, this column links to that column in another table."

3. **Indexes and Constraints**: Some tables have additional constraints like primary keys, unique indexes, or even composite primary keys. Indexes like `uniqueIndex` and `index` are used to optimize database queries and ensure data integrity.

4. **Special Features**: Some tables use features like vectors (for machine learning embeddings) and timestamps with time zone information. There are also default values set for some columns, like versioning with `default(1)`.

5. **Purpose**: This schema seems to be designed for a system dealing with legislative or governmental processes, given the use of terms like `afstemning` (voting), `dokument` (document), `møde` (meeting), and `sag` (case or matter). It's likely used in a context where tracking changes, relationships between different entities, and detailed documentation are crucial.

Overall, this file is all about organizing how data is stored and accessed in a PostgreSQL database using `drizzle-orm`, ensuring that the right structure and relationships are in place to support the application's needs.

## Explanation for `./server/database/relations.ts`
Alright, let's break it down!

This TypeScript file is all about defining relationships between various database tables using a library called `drizzle-orm`. It's like setting up a map that describes how each table is connected to others. This can be super useful when you're trying to fetch related data efficiently.

Here's a quick summary of what the file does:

1. **Imports and Setup**: It starts by importing a bunch of tables or entities from a `schema` file, which are probably defined elsewhere. Each of these entities represents a table in the database.

2. **Relations Function**: The `relations` function from `drizzle-orm` is used to define these connections. For each table, it specifies how it relates to other tables. This involves stating which fields in one table correspond to fields in another—these are your foreign keys and references.

3. **One-to-One and One-to-Many**: For each entity, relationships are described using `one` or `many`:
   - `one`: Describes a one-to-one relationship, where a single record in one table is linked to a single record in another.
   - `many`: Describes a one-to-many relationship, where a single record in one table is linked to multiple records in another.

4. **Specific Relationships**: The file meticulously sets up these relationships for each entity. For instance:
   - `afstemningRelations` links `afstemning` to `afstemningstype`, `møde`, and `sagstrin`.
   - `aktørRelations` links `aktør` to `aktørtype`, `periode`, and several many-to-many relationships like `dokumentAktør`.

5. **Complex Relationships**: Some entities have more complex relationships, like `aktørAktør`, which describes a relationship between two `aktør` entities, possibly with a role defined in `aktørAktørRolle`.

6. **Comments and Unused Code**: There are some commented-out sections, hinting at potential future or removed functionality (e.g., `svarDokumenter`).

In essence, this file is a comprehensive blueprint for how different pieces of the database puzzle fit together, making it easier to navigate and query related data in a structured way. It's like building a spider web of connections between all the important bits of your data.

## Explanation for `./server/oda/scheduler.ts`
Alright, here's what's going on in your `scheduler.ts` file. This script sets up a scheduler using the `cron` library to automatically synchronize entities every hour. Let’s break it down:

1. **Imports**: 
   - `CronJob` from the `cron` package is used to schedule tasks.
   - `syncAllEntities` is a function from `syncEntities`, which presumably handles the actual synchronization logic.

2. **Cron Job Setup**:
   - `syncJob` is a cron job that is scheduled to run every hour on the hour (`'0 * * * *'`).
   - When triggered, it logs the start of the synchronization process, attempts to run `syncAllEntities`, and logs success or any errors that occur.

3. **Time Zone**: 
   - The job runs in the 'Europe/Copenhagen' time zone. You can change this to match your needs.

4. **Functions**:
   - `startSyncScheduler()`: Starts the cron job, kicking off the automated hourly sync.
   - `runManualSync()`: Allows you to manually trigger the synchronization process independently of the scheduled job.

So, in essence, this file is all about automating and managing the synchronization of entities, with both scheduled and manual options available.

## Explanation for `./server/oda/syncSag.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this TypeScript file is up to. This code is all about synchronizing some "sag" data, which seems to be a kind of legal or case-related entity (likely because "sag" means "case" in Danish). Here's the gist:

1. **Imports**:
   - It brings in some types and functions from other parts of the project. These include `FtDomainModelsSag` (a type definition for the "sag" structure), `sagGet` (a function to fetch "sag" data), and `sagRepository` (a storage/repository handler for "sag" data).
   - `syncEntity` is an imported utility that helps with the synchronization process.

2. **Function `syncSag`**:
   - This is an asynchronous function designed to sync "sag" data.
   - It calls `syncEntity`, which is a generic utility function meant for syncing any type of entity. Here it's specifically dealing with the "sag" type.
   - Inside `syncEntity`, several parameters are passed:
     - `entityName`: Identifies the type of entity being synchronized, in this case, "sag".
     - `fetchFunction`: The function (`sagGet`) used to retrieve the "sag" data from a source.
     - `repository`: The `sagRepository`, where this data is stored or managed.
     - `mapData`: A function that transforms or maps the fetched "sag" data into a specific format. It takes a "sag" object and returns an object with specific properties that are likely relevant for storage or further processing.

So, in a nutshell, this file helps keep the "sag" data up-to-date by fetching it from some source, transforming it as needed, and saving it into a repository. It's a neat little piece of the data management puzzle in this codebase!

## Explanation for `./server/oda/utils.ts`
This TypeScript file is like a data management helper for a server application. It has two main functions for dealing with synchronization times of entities (like tables or datasets in a database):

1. **`getLastSyncTime(entity: string): Promise<Date>`**: This function fetches the most recent update time for a given entity from a database. It does this by selecting the maximum date (`MAX(opdateringsdato)`) from a table corresponding to the entity's name. If it finds a date, it returns it as a `Date` object. If it doesn't find anything (or if there's an error), it defaults to returning the Unix epoch start (`new Date(0)`, i.e., January 1, 1970).

2. **`updateLastSyncTime(entity: string, date: Date): Promise<void>`**: This function updates the last synchronization time for a given entity in a table called `synclogger`. It inserts a new row with the entity name and the given date. If there's already an entry for that entity (i.e., a conflict), it updates the date instead. This ensures that the sync time is always up-to-date. If there's an error during this operation, it logs the error to the console.

Overall, these functions are useful for keeping track of when data was last synchronized with a database, ensuring data consistency and effective data management in applications.

## Explanation for `./server/oda/syncPeriode.ts`
Sure thing! This TypeScript file is all about synchronizing "periode" data using some utility functions and repositories. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. **Imports**: The code imports type definitions and functions from various modules, like `FtDomainModelsPeriode`, `periodeGet`, `periodeRepository`, and `syncEntity`.

2. **Function Definition**: The main function here is `syncPeriode`, which is defined as an asynchronous function. This means it can handle operations that take time to complete, like fetching data from a database or an external API.

3. **syncEntity Call**: The function uses a generic utility function `syncEntity` to handle the synchronization process. This function is versatile and can work with different types of data models, as indicated by the generic `<FtDomainModelsPeriode, FtDomainModelsPeriode>`.

4. **Parameters Passed to syncEntity**:
   - **entityName**: Specifies the entity being synchronized, which is 'periode' in this case.
   - **fetchFunction**: Uses `periodeGet` to fetch the latest data that needs to be synchronized. This could be from an external service or a database.
   - **repository**: Uses `periodeRepository` to access the data storage for "periode" entities. This is likely where the data will be stored or updated.
   - **mapData**: A function that maps the fetched data to a specific structure. It extracts properties like `id`, `startdato`, `slutdato`, etc., from the "periode" data to ensure it fits the required format.

In essence, this code is designed to fetch "periode" data, transform it to the required format, and then update or sync it with a repository. This is a common pattern for keeping data consistent across different parts of an application or between different systems.

## Explanation for `./server/oda/syncUtils.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this TypeScript function does in a fun and digestible way!

### What's Happening?

This file `syncUtils.ts` is all about synchronizing data from an external API to your local database or data store. It's like a smart little robot that keeps your local data up-to-date with what's happening elsewhere. Here's how it works:

### Key Components:

1. **Context Creation**: 
   - It uses a `createContext` function to set up some context or environment for the sync operation. Think of it like preparing a workspace before starting the sync.

2. **Function Inputs**:
   - **`entityName`**: Name of the entity you want to sync.
   - **`fetchFunction`**: A function to fetch data from an API. It uses the context created earlier and fetches data based on some parameters.
   - **`repository`**: This is where the data will be stored locally. It's an interface that defines how to save the data.
   - **`mapData`**: A function to convert API data into a format suitable for local storage.
   - **`additionalSyncLogic`**: (Optional) Extra operations you might want to perform on each piece of data after it's fetched.
   - **`batchSize`**: Number of records to fetch in one go. Default is 100.

3. **Sync Process**:
   - It starts by getting the last time the sync was performed using `getLastSyncTime`. This helps in fetching only the new or updated data.
   - Data is fetched in batches. It uses query parameters like `$filter`, `$top`, `$skip`, and `$orderby` to control what data to fetch.
   - For each fetched item, it maps the data using `mapData`, and then stores it using the `repository`. If there's any additional logic needed, it runs that too.

4. **Looping and Error Handling**:
   - The while-loop keeps fetching data until there's none left to fetch.
   - If an error occurs during sync, it logs the error and re-throws it to ensure the calling function can handle it properly.

5. **Update Sync Time**:
   - After a successful sync, it updates the last sync time using `updateLastSyncTime`.

### Why is This Useful?

This function is super handy for keeping your databases in sync with external data sources. Whether it's syncing customer data, products, or any other entity, this function automates the heavy lifting, ensuring your local data is fresh and accurate.

So, in essence, this file is like your diligent data assistant, keeping everything in order behind the scenes!

## Explanation for `./server/oda/syncEntities.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code does in a fun and digestible way!

This TypeScript file is all about synchronizing different types of entities. Think of it as a backstage crew getting everything ready for a big show – each function is responsible for syncing a specific part of the data (or "entity"), like actors, meetings, documents, etc.

Here's the play-by-play:

1. **Imports**: At the top, it imports a bunch of functions. Each of these functions (`syncAktør`, `syncAfstemning`, etc.) is in charge of syncing a particular entity. The names suggest these are related to some kind of organizational or legislative data, like "Actor", "Voting", "Document", etc., but in Danish.

2. **Sync Functions Array**: It creates an array called `syncFunctions`. Each item in this array is an object with two properties: `name` (a string representing the entity's name) and `func` (the function to call for syncing that entity).

3. **Main Function - `syncAllEntities`**: This is the star of the show. It's an asynchronous function that loops through each item in the `syncFunctions` array. For each entity:
   - It logs a message saying it's starting the sync.
   - Then it calls the corresponding sync function and waits for it to finish (`await func()`).
   - Once done, it logs a message saying the sync is complete.

4. **Final Message**: After all entities are synchronized, it logs a final message to say everything went smoothly.

In short, this file automates the process of synchronizing multiple types of data entities, ensuring everything is updated and ready to go. Perfect for maintaining up-to-date data in an application!

## Explanation for `./server/oda/syncStemme.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this `syncStemme.ts` file is doing:

1. **Imports**: 
   - It's importing some types and functions from other files. Specifically, it's getting a type called `FtDomainModelsStemme` and a function `stemmeGet` from a utilities file, and another thing called `stemmeRepository` from a repository file. Lastly, it's using `syncEntity` from a sync utilities file.

2. **Function Definition**: 
   - The main function here is `syncStemme`. It's declared as an `async` function, which means it'll deal with some asynchronous operations (like waiting for a network request or database query to complete).

3. **syncEntity Call**:
   - Inside this function, it calls `syncEntity` with a generic type parameter `<FtDomainModelsStemme, FtDomainModelsStemme>`. This is a TypeScript feature where you're specifying the types of the data it's working with.
   - The `syncEntity` function seems to require a configuration object with:
     - `entityName`: A string 'stemme', likely indicating the name of the entity to sync.
     - `fetchFunction`: This is `stemmeGet`, probably a function that retrieves the latest data from some source (like an API).
     - `repository`: `stemmeRepository`, which likely handles storing or retrieving data from a database.
     - `mapData`: A function that takes a `stemme` object and transforms it into another object with specific properties (`id`, `typeid`, `afstemningid`, `aktørid`, `opdateringsdato`). This transformation is probably to ensure the data is in the right format for the repository.

4. **Purpose**:
   - The overall purpose of this code is to synchronize "stemme" data between a source (retrieved by `stemmeGet`) and a local repository (`stemmeRepository`). It fetches the data, maps it to the correct format, and then presumably updates or inserts it into the local storage.

In short, it's a data sync function for an entity called "stemme", pulling updates from a source and ensuring the local version is up-to-date.

## Explanation for `./server/oda/syncAktør.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code is doing in a fun and easy way!

You've got a TypeScript file here that's all about syncing some actor data. The main function, `syncAktør`, is handling this task. Here's a quick rundown of what's happening:

1. **Imports**: The code pulls in some types and functions from other files. It imports a type called `FtDomainModelsAktør` and a function called `aktørGet` from a utilities file, and it also gets `aktørRepository` from a repository file. Lastly, it imports `syncEntity`, a utility function for syncing.

2. **Function `syncAktør`**: This is an asynchronous function (hence the `async` keyword) that waits for some operations to complete.
   
3. **Calling `syncEntity`**: This is the main action inside `syncAktør`. The `syncEntity` function is a generic function, meaning it can handle different types of data, and here it's set up to work with the `FtDomainModelsAktør` type.

4. **Parameters for `syncEntity`**:
   - `entityName`: It's syncing something called 'aktør', which seems to be some kind of entity in your system.
   - `fetchFunction`: The `aktørGet` function is used to fetch the data that needs to be synced.
   - `repository`: It uses `aktørRepository`, probably to save or update the data in a database.
   - `mapData`: This is a function that takes an `aktør` object and maps its properties to a specific structure, ensuring the data is organized correctly before syncing.

In summary, this code is all about taking actor data from somewhere, processing it into a desired format, and then syncing it with a repository (likely a database) using some helper functions. It's a nice little automation task that keeps your data up-to-date!

## Explanation for `./server/oda/syncDokument.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code is doing!

The file `syncDokument.ts` is responsible for synchronizing "dokument" entities. Here's a quick rundown of how it works:

1. **Imports**: The code imports types and functions from other parts of the codebase:
   - `FtDomainModelsDokument` is likely a TypeScript type representing the structure of a "dokument".
   - `dokumentGet` is a function used to fetch "dokument" data.
   - `dokumentRepository` is likely an object or function for database interactions specifically related to "dokument" entities.
   - `syncEntity` is a utility function that handles the synchronization process.

2. **syncDokument Function**: This is an asynchronous function that calls `syncEntity` to handle the synchronization. It passes several parameters:
   - `entityName: 'dokument'` tells the sync utility what entity it's dealing with.
   - `fetchFunction: dokumentGet` is the function used to retrieve the documents from an external source.
   - `repository: dokumentRepository` tells the utility where to store or update the documents in the local database.
   - `mapData`: This is a transformation function that maps the fetched dokument data into a specific format, selecting and organizing fields like `id`, `typeid`, `statusid`, etc.

In essence, the function `syncDokument` automates the process of fetching "dokument" data, transforming it into the desired format, and then saving or updating this data in the local repository. It's like a bridge that keeps your local storage up-to-date with an external data source.

## Explanation for `./server/oda/syncMøde.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code does in a fun and digestible way.

You've got a TypeScript file that defines an asynchronous function called `syncMøde`. This function is all about synchronizing "meetings" (that's what "møde" means in Danish) data.

Here's the scoop on what's happening:

1. **Imports**:
   - It pulls in some types and functions from other files. The `FtDomainModelsMode` is a type, probably defining what a meeting object should look like.
   - `mødeGet` is a function used to fetch meeting data from some source.
   - `mødeRepository` is likely an interface to the database or some storage system where meeting data is saved.
   - `syncEntity` is a utility function that handles the nitty-gritty of syncing data.

2. **syncMøde Function**:
   - This function uses `syncEntity`, which seems to be a generic function designed to sync entities of a given type. It's like a smart assistant that takes care of syncing for you.
   - It feeds `syncEntity` with a bunch of parameters:
     - `entityName: 'møde'` tells it we're dealing with meetings.
     - `fetchFunction: mødeGet` is how it grabs the latest meeting data.
     - `repository: mødeRepository` is where it stores this data.
     - `mapData` is a function that cleans up or transforms the fetched meeting data into the format expected by the repository. It ensures fields like `id`, `titel`, `lokale`, etc., are properly mapped.

In essence, `syncMøde` is the orchestrator here, bringing together fetching, transforming, and saving of meeting data in a neat and modular way. This makes sure your meeting data is always up-to-date!

## Explanation for `./server/oda/sync.ts`
This TypeScript code defines a function called `runSynchronization` that is responsible for synchronizing entities. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Imports the `syncAllEntities` Function**: It imports a function named `syncAllEntities` from another file called `syncEntities`. This means `syncAllEntities` is a pre-defined function responsible for syncing whatever entities you're working with.

2. **`runSynchronization` Function**: This is an asynchronous function. It starts by logging "Starting synchronization..." to the console, which is basically a way of letting you know that the sync process is kicking off.

3. **Awaits `syncAllEntities`**: The function then calls `syncAllEntities` and waits for it to complete. The `await` keyword is used here because `syncAllEntities` is likely an asynchronous operation (probably involves some I/O tasks like fetching or updating data).

4. **Logs Completion**: Once `syncAllEntities` is done, it logs "Synchronization completed." to the console, signaling that the synchronization process is finished.

In short, the `runSynchronization` function acts as a wrapper to handle the synchronization process, providing start and end notifications in the console.

## Explanation for `./server/oda/syncAfstemning.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code is doing in a fun and simple way:

The `syncAfstemning.ts` file is like a smart helper that keeps two things in sync: a remote data source and your local database, specifically for something called "afstemning" (which seems to be a Danish term that usually means "vote" or "ballot").

Here's a quick rundown:

1. **Imports and Setup**: It imports some types and functions from other parts of the project. You have `afstemningGet` which is the function to fetch the data, and a couple of repositories: `afstemningRepository` and `stemmeRepository`, which are like special libraries for handling afstemning and stemme (vote) data.

2. **Function `syncAfstemning`**: This is the main function that does the syncing. It uses a generic helper function called `syncEntity` to do most of the heavy lifting.

3. **Inside `syncEntity`**:
   - **Entity Name**: It's syncing an entity called "afstemning".
   - **Fetch Function**: Uses `afstemningGet` to grab the latest data from an external source.
   - **Repository**: It saves or updates this data in `afstemningRepository`.
   - **Data Mapping**: It maps the fetched afstemning data to a specific structure (ID, number, conclusion, etc.).
   - **Additional Sync Logic**: If the afstemning includes something called "Stemme" (votes), it goes through each one and updates the local database using `stemmeRepository`.

In essence, this script ensures that the latest afstemning data, along with any associated votes, is pulled from a remote source and properly updated in your local setup. It's a neat way to keep everything aligned without manually updating records!

## Explanation for `./server/llm/generateQuestion.ts`
This TypeScript code is a function called `generateQuestion` that is designed to create a simple question about a legal case (`sag`) using a language model client, `LLaMAClient`. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Imports and Types**: 
   - It imports various types like `SagDetails`, `SagAktørWithRelations`, `FilContent`, and `DokumentWithRelations` from a local `types/sag` file, which are likely type definitions for different parts of the legal case data.
   - It also imports `LLaMAClient`, which is presumably a class for interacting with a language model API.

2. **Function Purpose**:
   - The function takes in `sagData`, which contains details about a legal case, as its parameter.
   - It then initializes an instance of `LLaMAClient`.

3. **Prompt Creation**:
   - A prompt is constructed for the language model to generate a question. The prompt is in Danish and instructs the model to create a question that a 10-year-old could understand, focusing on who, what, or how much.
   - Information from `sagData` is inserted into the prompt, including the title, a summary, the involved actors, and document titles.

4. **Question Generation**:
   - The function calls `generateResponse` on the `llm` instance, passing the constructed prompt to generate a question.
   - The generated question, along with the prompt, is returned in an object.

In essence, this function is a tool for automatically generating simple, comprehension-friendly questions about legal cases using AI.

## Explanation for `./server/llm/llamaClient.ts`
This TypeScript file defines a class called `LLaMAClient` that acts as a client for interacting with a local Language Model (LLM) service, possibly called "LLaMA". Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Initialization**: The class has a private property `apiUrl` which is set in the constructor. This URL is fetched from a runtime configuration (`useRuntimeConfig()`). If no URL is provided, it defaults to `http://localhost:8000`. This URL is the base address for the LLM service you're trying to communicate with.

2. **Methods**:
   - **`generateResponse(prompt: string): Promise<string>`**: This asynchronous method sends a POST request to the endpoint `/generate_question` on the LLM service. It sends the `prompt` text as part of the request body. The method logs the interaction and checks if a `question` is present in the response. If not, it throws an error. If successful, it returns the generated question.
   
   - **`search(query: string, topK: number = 5): Promise<any>`**: This method also sends a POST request, but to the `/search` endpoint. It sends a `query` and an optional `topK` value (defaulting to 5), which likely specifies the number of top results to retrieve. It logs the request and returns the search results if successful. If not, it throws an error.

3. **Error Handling**: Both methods have error handling that logs errors to the console and throws a new error with a descriptive message if something goes wrong during the request.

In essence, this file is all about providing a way to interact with a local LLM service to generate questions from text prompts and perform searches, with some decent error handling and logging for debugging purposes.

## Explanation for `./server/repositories/aktørRepository.ts`
Sure thing! Let's break down what this TypeScript code file does:

1. **Imports**: It imports a schema called `aktør` from the `../database/schema` path, a type `FtDomainModelsAktør` from `../../utils/oda`, and a `BaseRepository` class from `./baseRepository`.

2. **Class Definition**: It defines a class `AktørRepository` that extends `BaseRepository` using a type `FtDomainModelsAktør`. This means `AktørRepository` inherits all functionalities of `BaseRepository` but is specifically tailored to handle data or operations related to `aktør`.

3. **Constructor**: In the constructor of `AktørRepository`, it calls the constructor of the `BaseRepository` with `aktør` as an argument. This setup suggests that `aktør` is some kind of database model or schema that this repository will manage.

4. **Customization**: There's a comment indicating that specific methods for handling `aktør` can be added here, although none exist in the current code snippet.

5. **Export**: Finally, it creates an instance of `AktørRepository` and exports it as `aktørRepository`. This instance can be used elsewhere in the application to perform operations related to `aktør` entities.

In summary, this file sets up a specialized repository class for interacting with `aktør` entities, and it extends a generic repository class to leverage common database operations, while allowing for `aktør`-specific logic to be added when needed.

## Explanation for `./server/repositories/sagRepository.ts`
Alright, let's break it down! This code defines a TypeScript class `SagRepository` that extends a generic `BaseRepository`. Here's the gist of what's happening:

1. **Imports**:

1. **Imports**:
   - It imports `BaseRepository` from `./baseRepository`, which is probably a generic class for database operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - It imports `stemme` from `../database/schema`, which is presumably the database schema or model definition for the "stemme" entities.
   - It imports a TypeScript type `FtDomainModelsStemme` from `../../utils/oda`, which is probably used to enforce typing for the "stemme" entities.

2. **Class Definition**:
   - The `StemmeRepository` class extends `BaseRepository`, meaning it inherits all of its functionalities and likely customizes or adds additional methods specific to "stemme" entities.
   - The constructor calls `super(stemme)`, passing the "stemme" schema to the `BaseRepository` constructor, setting up the repository to work with that specific entity.

3. **Export**:
   - Finally, it exports an instance of `StemmeRepository` named `stemmeRepository`, which can be used in other parts of the application to interact with the "stemme" data.

In essence, this code sets up a repository for handling "stemme" data operations, leveraging a base repository for shared functionality and potentially allowing for additional, specific operations related to "stemme" in the future.

## Explanation for `./server/repositories/baseRepository.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code file does. It's a TypeScript class that acts as a base repository for database operations, using something called a "Drizzle ORM" for interacting with the database.

1. **Importing Stuff:** 
   - It imports `sql` from `drizzle-orm`, which is likely a tool for constructing SQL queries.
   - It imports `db` from another module that sets up the database connection.

2. **Defining an Interface:**
   - There's a `Table` interface that has a single property `id` of type `string`. This interface is used to ensure that any table being managed by this repository has an `id` field.

3. **BaseRepository Class:**
   - This is a generic class that can work with any table that extends the `Table` interface. It means you can use this class with any database table that has an `id` field.

4. **Constructor:**
   - Takes a `table` parameter, which represents the table this repository will manage. It assigns this to a protected variable `table`, which means it's accessible within the class and its subclasses.

5. **`upsert` Method:**
   - This method is for inserting or updating data in the table. 
   - It uses the `db.insert` method to insert the data. If there's a conflict (like a duplicate `id`), it updates the existing record instead (`onConflictDoUpdate`). It essentially makes sure there's only one record with a particular `id`.

6. **`getLastUpdate` Method:**
   - This method fetches the date of the most recent update for the table. 
   - It runs a query to get the maximum value of a column named `opdateringsdato` (which probably means "update date" in Danish).
   - If there's no result, it defaults to the Unix epoch start date, `new Date(0)`.

In summary, this file sets up a base repository with basic operations to insert/update records and to fetch the last update date for a table. It's designed to be extended or used with specific table classes that meet the basic requirements (like having an `id` field).

## Explanation for `./server/repositories/dokumentRepository.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this TypeScript code is doing:

1. **Imports**: 
   - It imports `BaseRepository` from `./baseRepository`. This is likely a generic class that provides basic database operations (like CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - It imports `dokument` from `../database/schema`, which is probably a database schema or model related to documents.
   - It imports a type `FtDomainModelsDokument` from a utility file, which probably defines the structure or interface for document-related objects.

2. **DokumentRepository Class**:
   - This class extends `BaseRepository` with a specific type `FtDomainModelsDokument`. This means `DokumentRepository` will inherit all the methods and properties from `BaseRepository`, but tailored for handling `FtDomainModelsDokument` entities.
   - The constructor calls `super(dokument)`, passing the `dokument` schema to the `BaseRepository`. This setup likely binds the repository to the `dokument` model, allowing it to perform operations like querying documents from the database.

3. **Export**:
   - It creates an instance of `DokumentRepository` and exports it as `dokumentRepository`. This instance is what other parts of the application will use to interact with the document data.

In summary, this file sets up a repository specifically for handling document data, leveraging a base repository class for common database operations. It's designed to be extended with document-specific methods if needed.

## Explanation for `./server/repositories/mødeRepository.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this TypeScript file is doing!

The code is defining a `MødeRepository` class, which is a specialized data access layer for handling "møde" (which probably means "meeting" in Danish) entities in a database. Here's a quick rundown:

1. **Imports**: 
   - It imports the `møde` schema from a database schema file. This likely defines the structure and rules for how "møde" data is stored.
   - `FtDomainModelsMode` is a type imported from a utility file, which probably describes the domain model used in the application.
   - `BaseRepository` is a generic class that provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It's being extended to make `MødeRepository`.

2. **MødeRepository Class**: 
   - This class extends `BaseRepository` using the `møde` schema, meaning it inherits all the basic database operations but specifically for "møde" entities.
   - The constructor calls `super(møde)`, passing the "møde" schema to the `BaseRepository` so it knows what type of data it's dealing with.

3. **Møde-Specific Methods**: 
   - There's a comment suggesting you can add methods specific to handling "møde" data, but none are currently defined.

4. **Export**: 
   - It creates an instance of `MødeRepository` and exports it as `mødeRepository`. This instance can be used throughout the application to interact with the "møde" data in the database.

In short, this file sets up a way to manage "møde" data using a repository pattern, making database interactions organized and more maintainable.

## Explanation for `./server/repositories/afstemningRepository.ts`

In a nutshell, it's a blueprint for interacting with the `afstemning` data in a structured and scalable way.

## Explanation for `./server/parser/meetingParser.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code is doing. Essentially, it's a TypeScript module designed to parse XML files related to meetings, extract relevant data, and store it in a database.

Here's a quick rundown:

1. **Imports and Setup**:
   - It uses various libraries like `fs` for file handling, `fast-xml-parser` for XML parsing, `consola` for logging, and a database connection module (`drizzle-orm`).
   - Some interfaces define the structure of the data being handled, such as `MeetingData`, `AgendaItem`, `SubItem`, and `Speech`.

2. **Utility Functions**:
   - Functions like `extractTingdokID` and `extractTextContent` are utility functions to handle ID extraction and text content processing from XML nodes.

3. **Main Functions**:
   - `processSpeechSegment`: Processes individual speech segments from the XML, generates "embeddings", and checks if the segment already exists in the database.
   - `saveSpeechToDatabase`: Saves or updates speech data in the database.
   - `parseSpeechesFromTale`: Handles parsing of all speeches from an XML node.
   - `parseMeetingXML`: Parses an entire XML file, extracts meeting metadata, finds IDs for meetings and sections, and organizes the data into structured formats.
   - `parseAgendaItem` and `parseSubItems`: These handle specific parts of a meeting agenda, including nested sub-items and their speeches.

4. **Database Interaction**:
   - The module interacts with a database to map IDs, check existing records, and insert or update data based on the parsed XML content.

5. **Exported Function**:
   - `parseMeetings`: This is the main function that triggers the parsing process. It looks for XML files in a specific directory, parses each file, and returns a structured representation of all parsed meetings.

In summary, `meetingParser.ts` is a robust script for processing XML data about meetings, transforming it into structured objects, and maintaining a database of this information. The logging via `consola` provides detailed feedback throughout the process, which is super helpful for debugging and monitoring.

## Explanation for `./server/api/sagDetails.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code does in a friendly walkthrough:

1. **Imports**: The code imports a database connection `db` and a database schema `sag`. It also pulls in a helper function `eq` from the `drizzle-orm` package to help with query conditions. Lastly, it imports some TypeScript types related to "sag" (which means "case" in Danish).

2. **Function `getSagDetails`**: This is an asynchronous function that takes a `sagId` (which is a number) and returns a promise that resolves to a `SagDetails` object.

3. **Database Query**: The function uses the `db` to query the `sag` table for the first record that matches the provided `sagId`. It does this using the `findFirst` method with a `where` condition that checks if the `sag.id` equals the `sagId` provided.

4. **Relations**: It fetches related data along with the main `sag` record:
   - **`sagAktør`**: Includes related `aktør` data.
   - **`sagdokument`**: Includes related `dokument`, and within that, any associated `fil` and its `filContent`.
   - **`taleSegment`**: Fetches related `taleSegment` data directly.

5. **Error Handling**: If no record is found (`result` is null), it throws an error saying "Sag not found".

6. **Response Construction**: If a record is found, it constructs and returns an object containing:
   - The `sag` data with all its relations.
   - A list of `aktører` involved in the case.
   - A transformed list of `dokumenter`, each with its title (`titel`), the first file's title, and the first file content's content if available.
   - The `taleSegment` data.

In summary, this function fetches detailed information about a specific case from the database, including its related actors, documents, and speech segments, and returns it in a structured format.

## Explanation for `./server/api/randomSag.ts`
Alright, let’s break down what this code does in a simple and fun way:

1. **Imports**: 
   - It pulls in some utilities from a `db` module and defines how to interact with a database using `drizzle-orm`.
   - Imports a specific `sag` schema from a database schema file.

2. **Function Purpose**:
   - The function `getRandomSag` is designed to fetch a random row from a database table referred to as `sag`.

3. **Query Details**:
   - **Filters**: It only considers rows where:
     - `typeid` is exactly 3.
     - `resume` and `titel` fields are not null (they have some data in them).
     - `periodeid` is greater than 130.
   - **Random Selection**: It orders the results randomly, ensuring that each call can return a different row.
   - **Limit**: Only one row is fetched, thanks to the `.limit(1)`.

4. **Return Value**:
   - It returns the first (and in this case, only) entry from the result of the query, which is a random `sag` entry meeting the criteria.

So, this function is like a lottery picker that pulls out a random "sag" (whatever that is in your context) from the database, but only if it matches the specified conditions! 🎲

## Explanation for `./server/api/actors.ts`
Alright, let me break it down for you!

This TypeScript code file, located at `./server/api/actors.ts`, is essentially setting up an API endpoint to fetch actor data from a database. Here's a quick rundown of what it does:

1. **Imports and Setup**: It pulls in several functions and modules, such as `defineEventHandler` for handling HTTP events, `createError` for error handling, and `getQuery` to parse query parameters from incoming requests. It also imports some database utilities from `drizzle-orm` and schema definitions for tables `aktør`, `sagAktør`, and `aktørtype`.

2. **Event Handler**: The main function is an event handler that gets triggered when the endpoint is called. It reads query parameters like `sagId`, `typeId`, `periodeId`, and `aktørId` from the request, converting them to integers where necessary.

3. **Query Building**: It constructs a database query using these parameters. It starts with selecting `id`, `navn` (name), and `type` from the `aktør` table, joining with `aktørtype` to get the actor's type. Depending on what parameters are provided, it adds additional filtering conditions:
   - Filters by `typeId` to get actors of a specific type.
   - Filters by `sagId` if provided, joining with `sagAktør` to get actors related to a specific case.
   - Filters by `periodeId` and `aktørId` if provided, narrowing results further.

4. **Execution and Return**: It executes the query, orders the results by actor name (`navn`), and returns the resulting list of actors as an array of `Actor` type.

5. **Error Handling**: If something goes wrong during the database operation, it logs the error and throws a server error with a 500 status code.

In essence, this script is a backend API endpoint that fetches actor information based on certain filters provided through the request's query parameters. It's like a nifty little data-fetching machine for the actors in your database! 🎭✨

## Explanation for `./server/api/randomQuestion.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code does in a fun and straightforward way:

1. **Imports and Setup**: The code is importing a few functions and a type from different modules. These are `getRandomSag`, `getSagDetails`, and `generateQuestion`. It also uses `createHash` from the `crypto` module to create unique keys for caching. There's a `Map` object being used as a simple in-memory cache.

2. **Cache System**: The cache is set up to store results for an hour (`CACHE_DURATION`). This means if you ask for the same thing within an hour, it just gives you the stored result instead of recalculating everything. Super efficient!

3. **Main Functionality**: 
   - It defines an event handler that runs asynchronously.
   - First, it calls `getRandomSag()` to fetch a random "Sag" (what exactly a "Sag" is, isn't clear from the code).
   - It then hashes this "Sag" to create a unique key for caching.
   - If there's a cached result for this key that’s still fresh (i.e., less than an hour old), it returns that result immediately.
   - If not, it fetches detailed information for the "Sag" using `getSagDetails`.
   - Then, `generateQuestion` creates a question and a prompt based on those details.
   - It stores the result (question, prompt, details, and timestamp) in the cache using the generated hash key.

4. **Error Handling**: If anything goes wrong during this process, the code catches the error, logs it, and throws a new error with a 500 status code (indicating a server-side problem).

In essence, this script is all about efficiently generating and serving random questions based on some "Sag" data, using caching to save time and resources. It's like a smart question generator that remembers what it's done for a while!

## Explanation for `./server/api/search.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code does! This piece of TypeScript is part of a server-side API endpoint for handling search queries in some web application. The code is structured to process a search request, find similar content based on embeddings, and return the most relevant results. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Query Extraction**: The code starts by extracting the search query (`q`) from the request event using `getQuery`.

2. **Embedding Generation**: It sends a request to an external service (`/get_embedding`) to generate an embedding vector for the search query. This is done by converting the query text into a numerical vector that can be used to measure similarity with other text data.

3. **Error Handling**: If generating the embedding fails (i.e., the response doesn't contain an embedding), it throws an error with a 500 status code.

4. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the similarity between the generated embedding and embeddings of existing data in two database tables: `filContent` and `taleSegment`. It uses a SQL operation that measures the distance between the embedding vectors.
   - The formula `1 - (A <=> B)` is used to calculate similarity, where `<=>` represents a distance metric (like cosine similarity), and `1 - distance` converts it into a similarity score (higher is more similar).

5. **Database Query**:
   - It performs a search in the `filContent` table, ordering results by similarity score in descending order and limiting them to the top 5.
   - Similarly, it performs a search in the `taleSegment` table with the same constraints.

6. **Result Combination**:
   - The results from both searches are combined into a single list.
   - The combined list is sorted again by similarity score to ensure the most relevant content appears first.

7. **Return Top Results**: Finally, the code returns the top 10 most similar results across both tables.

8. **Error Handling for the Whole Process**: If any part of the process encounters an error, it logs the error and throws a generic internal server error.

In simple terms, this code handles a search request by generating an embedding for the query, finding similar entries in two database tables, and returning the most relevant results. It's like asking a question and getting the closest matching answers from two different books!

## Explanation for `./server/api/test-fastapi.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code does in a snappy way!

This TypeScript file is setting up an event handler for a server endpoint using the `h3` library. It's likely part of a bigger web app. Here's the gist of it:

1. **Event Handler Setup**: The `defineEventHandler` function is used to create an asynchronous event handler. This is a function that will run when a certain endpoint is hit.

2. **Logging**: It starts by logging to the console that it's about to make a health check call to a FastAPI service. 

3. **Configuration Fetching**: It uses `useRuntimeConfig(event)` to get runtime configuration settings. This typically includes environment-specific settings like URLs, API keys, etc.

4. **Health Check Request**: It makes a GET request to the `/health` endpoint of a service, using the base URL from the configuration (likely pointing to a FastAPI backend service).

5. **Response Handling**: If the request is successful, it logs the response and returns an object indicating success, along with the response message.

6. **Error Handling**: If something goes wrong (like the FastAPI service is down or the request fails), it logs the error to the console and throws a custom error with a 500 status code, indicating a server-side problem.

In simple terms, this code is a small server-side script that checks if a FastAPI service is up and running and logs the result. If it can't reach the service, it throws an error.

## Explanation for `./server/api/perioder.ts`
This code is setting up an API endpoint using the `h3` framework. Here's what it does, step-by-step:

1. **Event Handler**: It defines an event handler using `defineEventHandler`. This means that when the endpoint is hit, this function will be executed.

2. **Database Query**: It performs a database query using `drizzle-orm`. The query is targeting a table or set of data referred to as `periode`.

3. **Select Operation**: It selects specific fields from the `periode` data: `id`, `titel`, and `slutdato`. These represent, presumably, a unique identifier, a title, and an end date for each period.

4. **Filtering**: It filters the data to include only those records where `periode.type` equals `'samling'`. This is done using the `where(eq(...))` function.

5. **Sorting**: The data is sorted in descending order based on the `slutdato` field, meaning the most recent periods will appear first.

6. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the list of periods that match these criteria. If there are no matching records, it returns an empty array.

In summary, this code fetches and returns a list of periods from a database where the type is 'samling', ordering them by their end date in descending order.

## Explanation for `./server/api/sagsstatus.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code is doing!

1. **Imports:**
   - It's using `defineEventHandler` from a library called `h3`, which is probably a part of a framework for handling server-side events or requests.
   - It's importing `db` from a local module `./db`, which is likely a database connection or some utility that helps interact with a database.
   - The `sagsstatus` is imported from a `../database/schema`, which seems to be a schema or table definition related to the database.

2. **Event Handler:**
   - This code defines and exports an event handler. This is typically used to manage HTTP requests in a server environment.
   
3. **Main Functionality:**
   - It asynchronously fetches data from the database. Specifically, it's selecting all the records from a table or entity named `sagsstatus`.
   - If it successfully retrieves the data, it returns the list of `sagsstatus` records.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - If there's an error during the data fetching process, it logs the error to the console and throws a new error with a 500 status code. This indicates an internal server error and provides a helpful message for debugging.

In essence, this file is part of a backend server setup, and it provides an endpoint to fetch all entries from a `sagsstatus` database table. If something goes wrong, it handles the error gracefully by logging it and sending an appropriate error response.

## Explanation for `./server/api/db.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this `db.ts` file does in a fun and digestible way!

1. **Imports**: The code starts by importing a few essential modules:
   - `pg`: This is the PostgreSQL client for Node.js, used here to create a connection pool.
   - `drizzle`: A library for working with databases, which is being used to set up an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with PostgreSQL.
   - `consola`: A fancy logger that makes console outputs more readable and stylish.

2. **Custom Logger**: 
   - The `CustomLogger` class implements the `Logger` interface from Drizzle ORM. It uses `consola` to log database queries and their parameters in a neat way. So every time a query runs, you'll see it nicely printed out with the parameters used.

3. **Database Configuration**:
   - The `databaseConfig` object holds all the necessary credentials and settings for connecting to the database. It pulls these from environment variables (like `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, etc.), and provides some defaults (like `localhost` for the host).

4. **Connection Pool**:
   - `Pool` is instantiated with the `databaseConfig`. This pool manages multiple connections to the database, which is efficient for handling multiple requests without overloading the database with new connections every time.

5. **Drizzle ORM Setup**:
   - Finally, `drizzle` is used to create the `db` export. It takes the connection pool and a configuration object containing the database schema (imported as `schema` and `relations`) and the custom logger. This setup allows you to interact with the database using the ORM, which abstracts away a lot of the SQL writing.

In short, this file sets up a connection to a PostgreSQL database using a connection pool, logs queries in a pretty format, and provides an easy way to interact with the database using Drizzle ORM. It's like setting up a helpful database assistant that keeps things organized and stylish!

## Explanation for `./server/api/ugeplan/index.ts`
This TypeScript file is part of a server-side application dealing with scheduling and meetings. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Event Handling**: It defines an event handler using the `defineEventHandler` function, which listens for incoming HTTP requests.

2. **Query Processing**: It extracts query parameters from the request, such as `date`, `aktørId` (actor ID), `mødetypeIds` (meeting type IDs), and `periodeId` (period ID). These are used to filter data.

3. **Date Calculations**: If a date is provided in the query, it calculates the start date and the date one week later. If no date is provided, it defaults to the current date.

4. **Database Queries**:
   - **Meetings**: It queries the database for meetings scheduled within the specified week. It can filter these based on meeting type IDs, actor IDs, and period IDs if provided.
   - **Agenda Items**: For each meeting, it fetches related agenda items.
   - **Actors**: It retrieves relevant actors who are involved in meetings during the specified timeframe. It focuses on actors of type 'Person' and checks their availability based on start and end dates.
   - **Meeting Types**: It fetches all possible meeting types from the database.

5. **Response**: The handler returns an object containing:
   - `weeklyDocket`: A list of meetings with their agenda items for the specified week.
   - `persons`: A list of relevant actors for the timeframe.
   - `meetingTypes`: A list of all available meeting types.

In essence, this file provides an API endpoint to fetch detailed scheduling information for a given week, including meetings, their agenda items, involved actors, and available meeting types. This is particularly useful in applications that manage or display schedules and related details.

## Explanation for `./server/api/sag/actors.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code is doing in a fun and simple way. This TypeScript file is part of a backend server's API, dealing with some sort of case management system. Here's the lowdown:

1. **Imports**: It's pulling in a few goodies, like `defineEventHandler`, `createError`, and `getQuery` from `h3`, and some ORM tools from `drizzle-orm`, alongside database schemas.

2. **Event Handler Setup**: It's setting up an event handler using `defineEventHandler`, which is essentially a function that's executed when a specific HTTP request hits this endpoint.

3. **Query Handling**: The handler grabs query parameters from the incoming request, specifically looking for an `id` that's supposed to be an integer (let's call it a case ID).

4. **Validation**: It checks if this `id` is a valid number. If it's not, boom—it throws a 400 error, telling the client that the ID has to be an integer.

5. **Database Query**: If the ID is cool, it proceeds to query the database. It's looking for "case actors" (`caseAktører`) associated with this case ID. 

   - It selects fields like actor ID, name, role ID, actor type, and period from the database.
   - It joins a few tables: `sagAktør` with `aktør`, and optionally `aktørtype` and `periode` (using inner and left joins).

6. **Return or Error**: If all goes well, it returns the info about these actors. If something goes wrong during this process, it logs the error and throws a 500 error, indicating a server issue.

In short, this code is a part of an API endpoint that fetches and returns details about actors involved in a specific case, based on the case ID provided in the request. If anything goes sideways, it handles errors pretty gracefully.

## Explanation for `./server/api/sag/partyStances.ts`
This TypeScript code is a server-side event handler for an API endpoint, and it's all about analyzing voting data related to a specific "sag" (case or issue). Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Query Parsing**: It grabs the `id` from the query parameters, which represents the specific case (sag) we're interested in.

2. **Validation**: It checks if this `id` is a valid integer. If not, it throws a 400 error, indicating a bad request.

3. **Fetch Votes**: It queries the database to gather all individual votes related to the specified sag, including details like person ID, name, vote type (e.g., for, against), vote count, and the date of the vote.

4. **Extract Person IDs**: From the votes, it extracts unique person IDs who participated in the voting.

5. **Check Vote Existence**: If no votes are found for the given sag, it throws a 404 error.

6. **Retrieve Party Affiliations**: It fetches party affiliations for the individuals based on the vote date. This means checking which party a person belonged to at the time of the vote.

7. **Mapping**: It creates a map linking each person ID to their party affiliation.

8. **Aggregate Party Votes**: It aggregates the votes by party, categorizing them into "for," "against," "abstain," and "absent."

9. **Determine Party Stances**: For each party, it calculates the overall stance (e.g., For, Against, Abstain, Neutral) based on the majority of votes and calculates the percentage of votes for the dominant stance.

10. **Error Handling**: If anything goes wrong during the process, it logs the error and throws a 500 error, indicating a server failure.

11. **Response**: Finally, it returns both the individual votes and the calculated party stances in the response.

This code essentially takes a political issue, analyzes how individuals and their parties voted on it, and summarizes the overall party positions.

## Explanation for `./server/api/sag/all.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code is doing in a simple way:

1. **Imports**:
   - It grabs a sorting function `desc` from a library called `drizzle-orm` for ordering results in descending order.
   - It uses `defineEventHandler` from `h3`, which is likely a framework for handling HTTP events or requests.
   - It imports a `db` instance to interact with a database and a `sag` object which likely represents a database table or schema.

2. **Event Handler**:
   - The code sets up an event handler using `defineEventHandler`. This function is asynchronous, meaning it'll handle database queries without blocking other operations.

3. **Database Query**:
   - Inside the handler, it runs a database query using the `db` instance. The query:
     - Selects data from the `sag` table.
     - Orders the results by `opdateringsdato` (which sounds like a Danish word for "update date") in descending order, meaning the most recent entries come first.
     - Limits the results to the top 10 entries.

4. **Response**:
   - It returns this list of up to 10 results. If something goes wrong, it catches the error.
   - If the error is an instance of `Error`, it logs the error and returns an object with the error message.
   - If the error isn’t a standard error instance, it logs a generic error message and returns an object stating that an unknown error occurred.

In short, this file is part of a server-side application that fetches the 10 most recently updated records from the `sag` table and handles any potential errors gracefully.

## Explanation for `./server/api/sag/documents.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this TypeScript code is doing in a fun and digestible way:

This file is essentially an API handler designed to fetch and return a list of document files from a database, along with their content, if available. Here's the lowdown:

1. **Imports and Setup**: This handler uses some cool libraries like `h3` for handling HTTP events and `drizzle-orm` for database operations. It imports a database connection and schema definitions.

2. **Event Handler Definition**: The code defines an event handler for HTTP requests using `defineEventHandler`.

3. **Query Parameter Parsing**: It grabs query parameters `id` and `page` from the incoming request. `id` represents a specific `sag` (let's say it's a case or category), and `page` is for pagination. It defaults to 1 if `page` isn't provided.

4. **Input Validation**: It checks if `id` is a valid integer. If not, it throws an error with a 400 status code, which means "Bad Request."

5. **Database Query**:
   - It queries the `sagdokument` table to find documents associated with the given `sagId`.
   - It also pulls related data from connected tables (`dokument`, `fil`, and `filContent`).
   - It implements pagination by using an `offset` calculated from the page number.

6. **File Content Handling**:
   - It flattens the result to get all files related to the documents.
   - For each file, it attempts to find the first chunk of content from the `filContent` table.
   - If content is found, it's added to the file info. If not, it notes that content isn't available.
   - If an error occurs while fetching content, it logs the error and adds an error message to the file info.

7. **Response**: It returns a structured list of files with content. If any error occurs during the process, it logs the error and throws a 500 status error, which is "Internal Server Error."

In summary, this API endpoint is like a waiter fetching and serving a list of document files, complete with a little appetizer of their content (if available), while making sure everything's in order and error-free. 🍽️

## Explanation for `./server/api/sag/index.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this TypeScript code is doing:

1. **Imports and Setup**: The code imports several functions and types needed for handling HTTP requests (`defineEventHandler`, `createError`, `getQuery` from `h3`), performing database operations (`eq` from `drizzle-orm`), and some local database and type definitions.

2. **Event Handler Definition**: The core of this file is an event handler for processing requests, likely in a web server context.

3. **Query Extraction**: When a request comes in, it extracts the query parameters from the request using `getQuery(event)`. It specifically looks for an `id` parameter and tries to convert it to an integer.

4. **Input Validation**: If the `id` isn't a valid number, it throws an error with a 400 status code, indicating a bad request.

5. **Database Query**: 
   - It queries the database using `db.query.sag.findFirst` to find a record in the `sag` table with a matching `id`.
   - It uses the `eq` function to filter the query where the `sag.id` matches the provided `id`.
   - The query is quite complex, fetching related data through nested relations, like `sagstrin`, `sagdokument`, and `sagAktør`, with further nested relations within them. This is likely to gather detailed information about a "sag" (which could be a case or matter in some context).

6. **Error Handling**: 
   - If no matching record is found, it throws a 404 error, indicating "Sag not found".
   - If any other error occurs during the process, it catches it and returns an error message.

7. **Response**: If everything goes smoothly, it returns the found record as part of a structured response (`SagApiResponse`).

In summary, this code handles an API endpoint that retrieves detailed information about a specific "sag" from a database, based on an `id` passed in the query. It includes robust error handling for invalid input and missing records.

## Explanation for `./server/api/sag/list.ts`
Alright, let’s break down what this TypeScript file does!

This file is part of a server-side API, specifically handling requests to list "sag" (which might be Danish for "case" or "matter") data from a database. Here’s a quick rundown of its main tasks:

1. **Imports and Setup:** The file imports various utilities for handling HTTP requests and building SQL queries. It also imports a custom logger and some database schemas.

2. **Event Handler:** The core of the file is an event handler defined by `defineEventHandler`. This function will handle incoming requests to this endpoint.

3. **Query Parameters:** It extracts query parameters from the request such as `periodeid`, `committee`, `politician`, `ministry`, `date`, `search`, `page`, and `pageSize`. These are used to filter and paginate the data.

4. **Database Query Construction:**
   - Starts with a base query that selects certain fields from the `sag` table where `typeid` is 3.
   - Applies additional filters based on the presence of query parameters:
     - Filters by `periodeid` if provided.
     - Joins other tables (`sagAktør`, `aktør`, `aktørtype`) to filter by `committee`, `politician`, or `ministry`, using specific `typeid` values for each.
     - Filters by date range if a date is provided.
     - Filters by `searchQuery` using a case-insensitive search (`ilike`) across multiple fields.

5. **Pagination:** It calculates the total number of records that match the query and determines the number of pages based on `pageSize`.

6. **Ordering and Limiting:** The results are ordered by `opdateringsdato` in descending order and limited to the specified `pageSize`.

7. **Response:** Returns a structured response containing the list of items, total pages, current page, page size, and total count of items.

8. **Error Handling:** If something goes wrong during execution, it logs the error and returns an error message.

So, essentially, this file handles fetching a filtered, searchable, and paginated list of "cases" from a database based on various criteria provided through query parameters.

## Explanation for `./utils/oda.ts`
The code file `./utils/oda.ts` is a TypeScript module that defines types and functions for interacting with an OData API. The module appears to be generated or designed to work with a specific API related to Danish parliamentary data (indicated by the names and parameters like `Afstemning`, `Aktør`, and `Dokument`), and it uses the `@typoas/runtime` package to handle requests.

Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Type Definitions**: It defines a bunch of TypeScript types representing different entities such as `Afstemning` (vote), `Aktør` (actor), `Dokument` (document), and many others. Each type includes properties relevant to that entity, like `id`, `title`, `date`, and nested references to other entities.

2. **CRUD Operations**: The module provides functions to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these entities through the API. For each entity type, there are functions to:
   - Retrieve a list of entities (`Get`)
   - Add a new entity (`Post`)
   - Get a single entity by its ID (`Get by ID`)
   - Update an entity (`Patch`)
   - Delete an entity (`Delete`)

3. **Relationship Handling**: It handles relationships between entities. For example, you can fetch related `Stemme` (votes) for a specific `Afstemning`.

4. **Date Transformations**: The module includes transformation functions that likely handle date parsing or formatting for API responses.

5. **Context Creation**: It includes a function `createContext` for setting up the context for API requests, including server configuration and authentication methods.

Overall, this module serves as a client-side utility for interacting with a specific OData API, focusing on Danish parliamentary data, offering structured types and easy-to-use functions for accessing and manipulating this data.

## Explanation for `./utils/cli.ts`
Alright, let's break it down!

This code is a simple command-line interface (CLI) script written in TypeScript, designed to be executed directly from the command line (hence the `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang at the top, which tells the system to use Node.js to run the script).

Here's what it does:

1. **Imports**: It imports a function called `logAllEntities` from a file named `logEntities`.

2. **Command-line Argument Handling**: It reads the command-line arguments passed to the script. Specifically, it looks at the third argument (`process.argv[2]`), which is the first argument after the script name.

3. **Command Check**: It checks if the command is `logEntities`. If it is, it calls the `logAllEntities` function.

4. **Fallback**: If the command isn't `logEntities`, it outputs 'Unknown command' to the console.

So basically, this script is a tiny CLI tool that recognizes one command (`logEntities`). When you run it with that command, it logs all entities using the `logAllEntities` function; otherwise, it just tells you that the command is unknown.

## Explanation for `./utils/logger.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this `logger.ts` file is doing!

1. **Imports `consola`:** It's using a library called `consola`, which is a fancy logging tool for Node.js. It makes logging messages like debug, info, warnings, and errors easier to handle.

2. **Configures `consola`:** The file sets up the logging level based on the environment. If the app is running in a production environment (`NODE_ENV === 'production'`), it sets the logging level to 3, which means only important info and errors are logged. If not, it sets the level to 4, which includes debug logs too. This is useful for seeing more details when you're developing.

3. **Exports `consola`:** Finally, it exports this configured `consola` instance so that other parts of the application can use it as the default logger. This makes sure everyone in the app uses the same logging setup.

So, in a nutshell, this file is setting up a logger that behaves differently in development and production environments, and then makes it available to the rest of the app.

## Explanation for `./utils/logEntities.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code does in a fun and easy way!

1. **Imports**: It's importing stuff from a module called `oda`. Specifically, it's grabbing an object with various functions (`oda`) and a `createContext` function. Think of `oda` as a toolkit with different tools for fetching data about various entities.

2. **Function Definition**: The main function here is `logAllEntities`. What does it do? It logs a bunch of entities to the console. It's like a roll call for different types of data.

3. **Context Creation**: It creates a `context` using the `createContext` function. This `ctx` is probably some setup or configuration needed for the `oda` functions to work properly.

4. **Entities Array**: There's a list of entities, each with a `name` and a `getter` function from `oda`. Each entity represents a type of data, like 'Afstemning' or 'Dokument'. The `getter` is the function that fetches data for that entity.

5. **Looping and Logging**: It loops over each entity in the list, tries to fetch the top item (with `{$top: 1}`), and logs the result to the console. If something goes wrong (like a network issue, for instance), it catches the error and logs an error message instead.

6. **Execution**: Finally, the `logAllEntities` function is called, kicking off the whole process.

So, in a nutshell, this code is like a data-fetching and logging machine. It connects to some data source, grabs a small sample of each type of entity, and prints it out. If it hits a snag, it lets you know what went wrong.

## Explanation for `./components/FilterSection.vue`
This Vue component, `FilterSection.vue`, is a user interface element designed to filter a list of proposals or similar items based on several criteria. Let me break it down for you:

1. **Template Structure**: 
   - The component's template consists of a grid layout with multiple columns that adjust based on the screen size (1 column on small screens, 2 on medium, and 3 on large).
   - It uses custom components like `USelectMenu` and `UInput` to create dropdowns and input fields.

2. **Filter Options**:
   - **`USelectMenu` Components**: These are dropdown menus for selecting a specific period (`periode`), a committee (`committee`), a politician, and a ministry. Each dropdown is linked to a model that updates with the selected value.
     - The period dropdown is searchable, allowing users to search through options by the title.
   - **`UInput` Components**: These allow users to select a date and enter a search query text, presumably to filter proposals by a specific date or search term.

3. **Reactivity with `computed`**:
   - Each filter option is bound to a `computed` property, which acts as a two-way data binding. It syncs the selected value from the props to the local state and emits an update event whenever the value changes.
   - The `emit` function triggers update events for each filter criterion (`periode`, `committee`, `politician`, `ministry`, `date`, and `searchQuery`).

4. **Props and Emission**:
   - The component receives data through props, which includes arrays of periods, committees, politicians, and ministries. It also takes initial values for each filter criterion.
   - For any change in the filter inputs, it emits update events to inform parent components of the changes.

In essence, this component provides a flexible and responsive filtering tool for a list of items, probably related to legislative proposals or similar, allowing users to narrow down their search with various criteria.

## Explanation for `./components/PartyItem.vue`
Alright, let's break down what this Vue component, `PartyItem.vue`, does in a fun and digestible way!

### What It Is:
This component is all about visually representing some data about a political party. Imagine it like a profile card for a party, where it shows a logo and a progress bar that indicates how often the party agrees on certain matters.

### The Template:
- **Layout**: It uses a flexible, horizontal layout (`flex`) with a fixed height of 10 units (`h-10`), making it suitable for nice, compact display.
- **Image**: Displays the party's logo with its respective `alt` and `title` attributes set dynamically based on the party's initials and full title.
- **Progress Bar**: A div that looks like a progress bar, showing how many agreements the party has. It's styled to have a rounded end (`rounded-r-full`) and its color is set to the party's theme color.

### The Script:
- **Props**: It accepts two props. 
  - `party`: An object containing info about the party (like agreements, disagreements, logo, etc.).
  - `normalize`: A boolean that decides if the width of the progress bar should be adjusted (default is `false`).
  
- **Computed Properties**:
  - `computedPct`: Calculates the percentage of agreements. If there are no agreements or disagreements, it returns `0` to avoid dividing by zero.
  - `computedWidth`: Determines the width of the progress bar. If `normalize` is true, the width gets scaled more dramatically for visual effect.

### The Style:
- The `.progress-bar` class ensures smooth transitions for any changes in the element's properties, using a nice cubic-bezier curve for a polished look.

### The Vibe:
In essence, this component is like a neat little badge for a political party, giving a quick visual cue on how often they agree on stuff, with a cool logo to boot. It's all about making data look good and be easy to read!

## Explanation for `./components/Question.vue`
This Vue component, `Question.vue`, is a part of a quiz-like application designed to present questions and capture user responses. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **UI Structure**:
   - It uses a `UCard` to create a card layout for each question.
   - The question's title is displayed prominently using `UTypography`, styled as a large, bold, italicized header.
   - Below the title, there's a set of buttons for user interaction.

2. **User Interaction**:
   - **Navigation Buttons**: 
     - A "previous" button (`Arrow U-turn Left`) allows users to go back to the previous question if they are not on the first step.
     - A "next" button (`Arrow U-turn Right`) appears only if there are more questions to answer.
   - **Response Buttons**:
     - "Thumb Up" and "Thumb Down" buttons let users indicate a positive ('yay') or negative ('nay') response to the question.
   - There's also a button that links to more information about the proposal, which opens in a new tab.

3. **State Management**:
   - The component relies on a store, `electionQuizStore`, for managing the quiz's state, including the current step/question and user responses.
   - It uses Vue's `computed` property to dynamically retrieve the current question based on the current step in the quiz.

4. **Functionality**:
   - `nextStep()` and `previousStep()` functions update the quiz's progress by changing the current question.
   - `updateAnswer(answer)` records the user's answer, updates the store, and ensures the page scrolls to the quiz progress.
   - `saveAnswer(answer)` sends the user's response to an API endpoint (`/api/vote`) using a POST request. This includes the question's title, ID (`ftid`), session (`samling`), and the user's vote.

Overall, this component is part of a quiz interface allowing users to navigate through questions, submit their answers, and potentially learn more about each question's context.

## Explanation for `./components/Parties.vue`
Alright, let's break down what this Vue component is doing:

1. **Template Structure**: 
   - The component is rendering a list of parties using a `<transition-group>`. This is a Vue feature that provides animations for list items when they're inserted or removed.
   - There are two conditional renderings based on whether the `parties` prop is provided or not:
     - **If `parties` prop is not provided** (`v-if="!parties"`): It defaults to rendering parties from `electionQuizStore.sortedQuizResult`, a sorted list presumably managed by a Vuex store or similar state management.
     - **If `parties` prop is provided**: It renders the passed `parties` array and also passes an additional `normalize` prop to each `PartyItem`.

2. **Script Section**:
   - It imports and utilizes `useElectionQuizStore` from a store file located in `@/stores/electionQuiz`, which seems to be a setup function for accessing some state management.
   - The component accepts two optional props:
     - `parties`: an array of `Party` objects (from a specified type).
     - `normalize`: a boolean to determine some sort of normalization on the `PartyItem` components.

3. **PartyItem Component**:
   - The list items (`<li>`) within the `<ul>` are composed of `PartyItem` components, which are likely responsible for displaying individual party information. Depending on the presence of `normalize`, it may alter how these items are displayed.

4. **Styling**: 
   - There's a `<style>` block, but it's empty, suggesting no specific styles are applied in this component.

In essence, this component dynamically renders a list of parties either from a provided prop or from a store, and it uses transition effects to animate the list changes.

## Explanation for `./components/FilContent.vue`
Alright, let's break down what this code is doing! 

This Vue component, `FilContent.vue`, is essentially creating a nice-looking accordion UI element, which is a common way to display collapsible content. Here's a quick rundown:

1. **Props**: The component takes in a `files` prop, which is expected to be an array of objects. Each object represents a file with at least an `id` and a `title`.

2. **Accordion Items**: The `accordionItems` is a computed property that transforms the `files` prop into a format that the accordion can use. Each file's `title` becomes a `label` for the accordion item, and the whole file object is converted to a JSON string for the `content`. This could be handy if you want to display more detailed info about each file when the accordion item is expanded.

3. **Template Structure**: The template uses a `UAccordion` component, which is a custom accordion component (maybe from a UI library). It iterates over `accordionItems` and creates an accordion item for each one.

    - **UButton**: Each accordion item is a button (`UButton`), and has a few styling classes to make it look nice (like `border-b`, `border-gray-200`).

    - **Slots**: 
        - The `#leading` slot contains an icon (looks like a newspaper icon) in a styled, rounded area.
        - The `#default` slot displays the index and label (title) of the item.
        - The `#trailing` slot has a chevron icon, which rotates when the accordion is open (thanks to the `rotate-90` class combined with Vue's dynamic class feature).

4. **Styling**: There’s a placeholder for scoped styles, but it's currently empty. This means all styling would be handled elsewhere or by default styles from the used UI components or libraries.

In a nutshell, `FilContent.vue` is a component that takes a list of file objects, and displays them in an accordion format, with each item showing its title and capable of expanding to reveal more data about the file. The component is structured to make it easy to extend with additional styling or functionality as needed.

## Explanation for `./components/SagTimeline.vue`
Alright, let's break down what this Vue component does!

### Overview:

This is a Vue 3 component that creates a timeline display for a specific "sag," which is likely a case or event, based on the context. The component uses TypeScript and is styled with scoped CSS. Here's the main functionality:

### Template Section:

- **HTML Structure**: The component renders a timeline using a list. Each timeline item displays a date, title, and a description for steps related to a "sag."
- **Data Binding**: It uses Vue's interpolation to dynamically display the title of the "sag" and each step's details.

### Script Section:

- **Imports**: Utilizes Vue's reactive system (`ref`, `onMounted`, `computed`) and Vue Router for routing logic. It also incorporates a store (`useSagStore`) and a composable (`useSagDocuments`) to manage state and actions related to the "sag."
- **Reactive Variables**:
  - `sagId`: Extracted from the route parameters, this identifies which "sag" to display.
  - `sag`: A computed property that accesses the current "sag" from the store.
  - `sagstrin`: A computed property that lists the steps (`sagstrin`) related to the "sag."
- **Lifecycle Hook**: 
  - `onMounted`: Fetches details of the current "sag" and associated documents as soon as the component is mounted.
- **Helper Functions**:
  - `formatDate`: Formats date strings into a more readable format.
  - `getStepDescription`: Generates a description for each step, potentially utilizing details like page numbers or references (`folketingstidende`).

### Style Section:

- **Styling**: 
  - The timeline has styles for layout and aesthetics, like the timeline line and markers.
  - Uses CSS to position elements, style the timeline, and add visual markers for each step.

### Purpose:

This component is designed to visually represent the timeline of events or steps related to a particular "sag." By fetching and displaying dynamic data based on a route parameter, it allows users to see the history or progression of a case or event in a clear, chronological format.

## Explanation for `./components/PartyStanceVisualization.vue`
Alrighty, let's break down what this Vue component does!

### Overview:
This component, `PartyStanceVisualization`, is designed to display the stance of different parties on a specific issue, identified by a `sagId`. It's essentially a visual bar chart that shows each party's stance and the percentage of support or opposition they have towards the issue.

### Template Explanation:
- **Structure**: The HTML structure includes a headline and three conditional sections. It shows a "Loading..." message while data is being fetched (`pending`), displays an error message if fetching fails (`error`), and finally, renders the party stances if data is successfully retrieved.
- **Party Stances**: For each party, it displays:
  - The party's name.
  - A bar representing their stance with a width proportional to their percentage of support or opposition. The color of the bar depends on the stance: green for "For", red for "Against", and grey for any other stances.

### Script Explanation:
- **Data Fetching**: It uses the `useFetch` hook to get party stances from an API endpoint `/api/sag/partyStances`, using a `sagId` extracted from the route parameters.
- **Stance Color Function**: `getStanceColor` is a helper function to determine the color of the stance bar based on whether the stance is "For", "Against", or something else.

### Style Explanation:
- **Styling**: Basic CSS styles are applied to ensure the component looks neat and keeps elements aligned. The `stance-bar` has a rounded appearance with a color based on the stance, and text centered inside the bar.

### Conclusion:
In short, this component visually represents how different parties stand on a particular issue, using a color-coded bar chart. It's a neat way to quickly grasp the political landscape regarding a specific topic!

## Explanation for `./components/ProposalList.vue`
Alright, let's break down what this Vue component does. It's called `ProposalList.vue` and it's responsible for displaying a list of proposals in a grid format.

### Template Section:
- **Grid Layout**: The outer `<div>` uses a grid layout with some spacing between items (`gap-6`).
- **Proposal Loop**: It iterates over a list of proposals using `v-for`, which is Vue's way of looping through arrays. Each proposal is represented by a `div`.
- **Card Styling**: Each proposal is styled as a card with a white background, rounded corners, padding, and a shadow for a nice look.
- **Content Display**:
  - **Title**: Shown in bold and larger font (`text-xl font-bold`).
  - **Number**: Displayed in a gray, slightly smaller font.
  - **Summary**: A brief description of the proposal.
  - **Update Date**: Shows when the proposal was last updated with a smaller, gray font.
- **Link**: There's a Nuxt.js link (`<nuxt-link>`) that directs users to a detailed page for each proposal. The link uses a dynamic path based on the proposal's ID.

### Script Section:
- **Props Definition**: This component expects a prop named `proposals`, which is an array. It's marked as required, meaning the component won't work properly without this data.

In essence, this component is a reusable way to display and navigate a series of proposals with their essential details in a visually structured manner.

## Explanation for `./components/HeaderMenu.vue`
Alright, let's break down what this Vue component is doing:

1. **Template Structure**: It's a Vue component with a navigation header that looks quite sleek, thanks to some gradient backgrounds. It uses a `<Disclosure>` element (from Headless UI) to show/hide navigation links on smaller screens.

2. **Responsive Navigation**:
   - For larger screens (`md:block`), it displays navigation links like "Om Unfuck The System", "Valgtest", and "Lovforslag" directly in the header.
   - For smaller screens (`md:hidden`), it uses a burger menu icon (bars) that transforms into a close icon (x-mark) when clicked. This toggles a dropdown menu with the same links.

3. **Branding**: The logo links back to the homepage and is displayed on all screen sizes.

4. **Color Mode Button**: There's a component called `<ColorModeButton />` which suggests functionality related to switching between dark and light modes—though its implementation isn't shown.

5. **GitHub Link**: On larger screens, there's a GitHub icon that links to the project's GitHub page.

6. **Header Title**: Below the navigation, there's a header with a dynamic title. The title animates into view with a cool slide-in effect from left to right. This title comes from `mainStore.headerTitle`, suggesting a reactive data source.

7. **Script Setup**:
   - The script uses the Composition API (with `script setup`) and TypeScript for type safety.
   - It imports components from Headless UI for the responsive menu.
   - It defines a `navigation` array to store the menu items and their links.

8. **Styling**: The component includes CSS animations for the header title, making it slide in when it appears and slide out when it disappears.

Overall, this component creates an attractive and responsive header menu for a Vue application, complete with animations and functionality for different screen sizes. It's designed to be both functional and visually appealing.

## Explanation for `./components/SearchBar.vue`
This Vue component, `SearchBar.vue`, is a simple search interface. Here's a quick breakdown of what it does:

1. **Data Setup**: It uses the `ref` function to create reactive variables `searchQuery` (for what the user types in) and `searchResults` (for holding the search results).

2. **Search Functionality**: The `performSearch` function is triggered when the user clicks the "Search" button. It makes an asynchronous GET request to the `/api/search` endpoint, passing the user's query as a parameter. The response is then stored in `searchResults`.

3. **Emit Event**: After performing a search, it emits a custom `search` event with the current search query. This can be used by parent components to react to the search action, like logging the query or handling additional logic.

4. **Template Structure**: The HTML template includes an input field bound to `searchQuery` for user input and a button to trigger the search. If there are any results, it displays them in a list, showing each result's content and source.

Overall, it's a neat, self-contained search component that fetches and displays search results based on user input, emitting an event to notify others of the search action.

## Explanation for `./components/AktørList.vue`
This Vue component, `AktørList.vue`, is responsible for displaying a list of "aktører" (which translates to "actors" or "participants" in English, depending on the context) on a web page. Here's a quick rundown of what it does:

1. **Template Section**: 
   - It displays a header with the title "Aktører".
   - If data is still loading (`isLoading` is true), it shows a "Loading..." message.
   - Once the data has loaded, it renders a list (`<ul>`) of `aktører`, where each actor's name (`aktør.navn`) is shown in a list item (`<li>`). Each list item uses the actor's `id` as a unique key to help Vue efficiently update the list.

2. **Script Section**: 
   - It uses the `useAktorer` function (likely a composable function, given the Vue Composition API context) to get `aktører`, `isLoading`, and `error` reactive variables.
   - If there's an error while fetching the "aktører", it logs an error message to the console.

Overall, this component is a neat example of how to fetch and display a list of items with Vue 3's Composition API, handling loading states and errors gracefully.

## Explanation for `./components/RandomQuestion.vue`
Alright, let's break down what this Vue component does in a fun and easy way:

### **Purpose:**
The `RandomQuestion.vue` component is all about fetching and displaying a random question along with a prompt from an API endpoint. It's like a surprise Q&A generator!

### **Template Section:**
- The `<template>` part is the HTML structure:
  - It shows a header saying "Random Question".
  - If there's an error, it displays that error.
  - If a prompt exists, it displays the prompt and question.
  - There's a button to fetch a new question, which gets disabled and shows "Loading..." while a new question is being fetched.

### **Script Section:**
- **Imports**: It uses `ref` and `onMounted` from Vue to handle reactivity and lifecycle events.
- **Reactive Variables**:
  - `question`, `prompt`, `error`: These hold the current question, its prompt, and any error message, respectively.
  - `isLoading`: Keeps track of whether the component is in the middle of fetching data.
  
- **`fetchNewQuestion` Function**:
  - Clears any previous error message and sets `isLoading` to true.
  - Tries to fetch data from `/api/randomQuestion`.
  - If successful, it updates `question` and `prompt` with the new data.
  - If not, it updates `error` with a relevant message.
  - Finally, it sets `isLoading` back to false, regardless of success or failure.

- **Lifecycle Hook**:
  - `onMounted(fetchNewQuestion)`: This function runs automatically when the component is first loaded, fetching the initial random question.

So, in essence, the component serves as a simple interface that reaches out to an API, grabs a question and its prompt, and shows them, while gracefully handling loading states and errors. It's a neat little package!

## Explanation for `./components/ColorModeButton.vue`
This Vue component, `ColorModeButton.vue`, is a toggle button that switches the color mode of a website between light and dark themes. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Script Setup**: 
   - It uses the `useColorMode` function, which likely manages the color mode state (e.g., 'light' or 'dark').
   - A computed property `isDark` is defined. It has a getter that returns `true` if the current color mode is 'dark' and a setter that toggles the `colorMode.preference` between 'light' and 'dark'.

2. **Template**: 
   - The button (`UButton`) displays an icon based on the current mode: a moon icon for dark mode (`i-heroicons-moon-20-solid`) and a sun icon for light mode (`i-heroicons-sun-20-solid`).
   - It has a click event that toggles the `isDark` property, effectively changing the theme.
   - The `ClientOnly` component ensures that the button is only rendered on the client side, probably to avoid server-side rendering issues with JavaScript-dependent features.
   - A fallback template provides a placeholder (an empty `div` with defined width and height) if the button can't be rendered immediately.

In essence, this component provides a user-friendly way to toggle between light and dark themes on a website with a simple button click.

## Explanation for `./components/PaginationControls.vue`
This Vue component is all about pagination controls, which are those handy little widgets you use for navigating through pages of a list or data set. Here's how it works:

1. **Template Structure**: It's got a simple layout with a couple of buttons and a text span in between. These buttons let you move to the previous or next page.

2. **Buttons**:
   - The "Forrige" button (means "Previous" in Danish) decreases the page number by 1 when clicked. It's disabled if you're already on the first page (`currentPage === 1`).
   - The "Næste" button (means "Next" in Danish) increases the page number by 1 when clicked. It's disabled if you're on the last page (`currentPage === totalPages`).

3. **Text Display**: It shows the current page and the total number of pages in a format like "Side 3 af 10" (meaning "Page 3 of 10").

4. **Props**: The component uses `currentPage` and `totalPages` as props. These are required numbers that tell the component which page you're on and how many pages there are in total.

5. **Emits**: When you click a button, the component emits a `change-page` event with the new page number, allowing the parent component to update the current page.

In a nutshell, this component is a neat little tool for navigating through paginated content in a web app, with some text in Danish to keep things interesting!

## Explanation for `./components/PdfViewer.vue`
The `PdfViewer.vue` component is a Vue component designed to display a PDF file. Here's a quick breakdown of what it does:

1. **Button to Open PDF**: There's a button that, when clicked, will either open a PDF in a new browser tab or display it in a modal overlay, depending on the PDF's URL format.

2. **Props**: It takes two props:
   - `pdfUrl`: A required string that specifies the URL of the PDF file. If the URL starts with "http," the PDF opens in a new tab.
   - `buttonText`: An optional string that customizes the button's text. It defaults to "View PDF" if not provided.

3. **Modal Display**: If the `pdfUrl` doesn't start with "http," clicking the button will show the PDF in a modal overlay:
   - This overlay covers the entire screen with a semi-transparent black background for focus.
   - The PDF is displayed using an `<iframe>` within this overlay.
   - There's a close button (`&times;`) in the top-right corner of the modal to hide the PDF.

4. **Interactivity**: The component uses Vue's `ref` to manage the visibility state of the modal (`showPdf`). Functions `openPdf` and `closePdf` toggle this state.

This setup allows for flexible PDF viewing, either externally in a new tab or internally within the app's interface, based on the URL structure of the PDF.

## Explanation for `./public/mockServiceWorker.js`
This JavaScript file is part of a setup using Mock Service Worker (MSW), a library for intercepting network requests in a web application and mocking their responses. It's often used in development and testing environments to simulate API interactions without needing a live server.

Here's a quick rundown of what it does:

1. **Service Worker Lifecycle Management**: The code registers event listeners for the `install`, `activate`, and `fetch` events of the service worker. This allows the service worker to control when it should start handling requests, which clients are active, and how to deal with network requests.

2. **Client Communication**: It listens for messages from clients (e.g., the browser or web pages) and manages states like keeping connections alive, checking integrity, and enabling or disabling mocking for specific clients.

3. **Request Handling**: When a network request is intercepted, it checks if it should be mocked or passed through to the actual network. It can simulate successful responses, errors, or even network failures based on predefined rules or conditions.

4. **Mock Responses**: If mocking is active and a request is eligible, the service worker communicates with the client-side MSW to handle the request and provide a mocked response.

5. **Utility Functions**: There are helper functions for serializing headers, sending messages to clients, delaying promises (to simulate latency), and generating unique request IDs.

Overall, this file is a crucial part of enabling MSW to intercept and mock HTTP requests in a development or test environment, but it should not be used in production.

## Explanation for `./layouts/default.vue`
Alright, so this file named `default.vue` defines a layout for a Vue.js application using a `.vue` single-file component. Here's a quick rundown of what's happening:

- **Template Structure**: The `<template>` section is where the component's HTML structure is defined.
  
- **UNavbar Component**: Inside the `<div>`, there's a `<UNavbar>` component, which is likely a custom navigation bar component.

- **UNavbarItem Components**: Within the `<UNavbar>`, there are multiple `<UNavbarItem>` components. These are probably custom components used to create navigation links. Each one has a `to` attribute that specifies the route it will navigate to:
  - `/` for "Home"
  - `/ugeplan` for "Ugeplan"
  - `/sag` for "Sag"
  - `/test-api` for "Test API"

- **<slot />**: The `<slot />` tag is used to insert other content or components into this layout. It acts as a placeholder where child content can be injected.

In essence, this component sets up a basic page layout with a navigation bar, and it allows for additional content to be plugged in using the slot. It's like a template you can use across different pages of the app to maintain a consistent look and feel.

## Explanation for `./scripts/parseMeetings.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code is doing in a fun and digestible way!

This TypeScript file, `parseMeetings.ts`, is like a little worker bee whose job is to handle the process of parsing meetings. Here's the scoop:

1. **Imports**: 
   - `parseMeetings`: A function from another file that presumably does the heavy lifting of parsing meeting data.
   - `consola`: A logging utility that helps print out messages to the console in a neat way.

2. **Main Function (`runParser`)**: 
   - It's an `async` function, meaning it can handle asynchronous operations using `await`.
   - **Start Logging**: Uses `consola.info` to announce that the parsing process is starting.
   - **Timing the Process**: Captures the start time before calling `parseMeetings`.
   - **Parsing Meetings**: Calls `parseMeetings()` which presumably fetches or processes meeting data.
   - **End Timing**: Captures the end time after parsing is done and calculates how long it took.
   - **Count and Success Message**: Counts how many meetings were parsed and logs a success message with the time taken.
   - **Completion Message**: Logs that the process has completed successfully.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If anything goes wrong during parsing, it catches the error and logs it using `consola.error`.

4. **Run the Function**: 
   - `runParser()` is called at the end, and if it fails catastrophically, it logs the error and exits the process with a non-zero status.

In a nutshell, this script is all about starting a meeting parsing process, timing it, logging the success or failure, and handling any mishaps along the way. Think of it as a diligent assistant that keeps tabs on meeting data and logs everything neatly.

## Explanation for `./scripts/processDocuments.ts`
This TypeScript file `processDocuments.ts` is designed to handle the processing of HTML documents located in a specific directory. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Imports and Setup**: It imports necessary modules like `fs` for file system operations, `path` for handling file paths, and some database-related modules for potential database operations. It also uses `drizzle-orm` for ORM-related tasks.

2. **Document Discovery**:
   - It defines a function `getDocumentFiles` that recursively reads through a directory (`assets/data/html` in this case) to find all `.html` files. It stores the full path of these files in an array called `files`.

3. **Concurrent Processing**:
   - The `processDocuments` function is the main driver of the script. It retrieves the list of HTML files and determines the number of worker threads to use, capped at 4. The `Worker` class creates these threads to handle file processing concurrently.
   - It splits the list of files into chunks and assigns each chunk to a worker. This division allows the script to process multiple files simultaneously, improving efficiency.

4. **Worker Communication**:
   - For each worker, it sets up message handlers to listen for messages indicating completion or errors. When a worker finishes processing its assigned files, it sends a message back to the main thread.

5. **Error Handling and Cleanup**:
   - It uses a `try-catch` block to handle any errors during the processing. If all tasks complete successfully, it logs a success message. If there are errors, it logs them.
   - Finally, it ensures that all worker threads are terminated after processing, regardless of success or failure, to free up resources.

6. **Execution**:
   - The `processDocuments` function is called and any unhandled errors are caught and logged, ensuring the script exits gracefully in case of failures.

Overall, this script efficiently processes a batch of HTML files using parallelism, making it useful for tasks like data extraction, transformation, or loading into a database.

## Explanation for `./scripts/worker.ts`
Alright, let's break down what this code is doing in a fun, digestible way:

This TypeScript file is essentially a worker script that processes documents and generates embeddings from them. Here's the play-by-play:

1. **Setup and Imports**: The script imports necessary modules for file handling (`fs` and `path`), database operations, and web requests. It also imports types and utilities for working with web workers.

2. **Text Cleaning**: There's a function called `extractMainContent` that cleans up a text document. It removes lines that are empty, single letters, numbers, or match specific patterns (like headers and footers). This is like tidying up a document by removing unnecessary clutter.

3. **Embedding Generation**: The `generateEmbedding` function sends the cleaned-up text to an external service running locally that processes document embeddings. It uses `$fetch` to make a POST request and expects a response with the processed data.

4. **Document Processing**: The main function here is `processDocument`. Here's what it does:
   - It checks if the file has already been processed by querying a database.
   - If not processed, it reads the file, cleans it up using `extractMainContent`, and sends it off to get embeddings.
   - It then stores these embeddings along with metadata (like version and chunk index) in a database.

5. **Handling Messages**: The script listens for messages (likely file paths) sent to it. For each file, it runs the `processDocument` function. Once done or if an error occurs, it sends a message back to indicate completion or failure.

In summary, this script acts like a diligent librarian who tidies up documents, extracts key points, gets them analyzed, and neatly files away the results in a database for future reference. It's all about automating the process of document embedding generation and storage.

## Explanation for `./pages/index.vue`
Alright, let's break it down! This code is for a Vue.js single-file component located at `./pages/index.vue`. Here's what it does:

1. **Template Section**: This is the HTML part of the component. It displays a heading with the text "Welcome to the Danish Parliament Question Generator". Below the heading, it includes a component called `RandomQuestion`.

2. **Script Section**: This part is written in TypeScript (hence the `lang="ts"`). It imports the `RandomQuestion` component from the `~/components/RandomQuestion.vue` file. The `script setup` syntax is a Vue 3 feature that simplifies component setup by eliminating the need for the `export default` object.

In essence, this file sets up a page that shows a welcome message and includes some functionality (likely generating or displaying a random question) provided by the `RandomQuestion` component.

## Explanation for `./pages/404.vue`
This code is for a custom 404 error page in a Vue.js application, using TypeScript for scripting. When a user navigates to a non-existent page, this component will display. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Template Section**: This contains the HTML structure and some text in Danish. It displays an image (likely a funny or thematic one since it's a 404 page) and a message saying something like "Oh oh no! We couldn't find the page. It might be part of the 'old' Unfuck The System.dk." It also includes a link to a GitHub repository, suggesting users check there for updates or plans.

2. **Script Setup**: 
   - It imports `useMainStore` from a Vuex store (or similar state management library), which probably manages global state across the app.
   - It sets the page title using `useHead` to "Unfuck The System.dk – page not found", ensuring the browser tab displays a relevant title.
   - In the `onMounted` lifecycle hook, it updates a header title in the store to "404 – side not found," which might be used elsewhere in the app to reflect the current page state.

Overall, this file is handling the user experience for lost visitors, giving them a bit of personality and a redirect option to GitHub for more information.

In essence, it's a neat little quiz app component for a political test, giving users a way to engage with political content in a structured and interactive manner.

## Explanation for `./pages/test-api.vue`
This Vue component is a simple interface to test a connection to a FastAPI backend. Here's a quick breakdown of how it works:

- **Template Section**: It displays a heading "API Test" and a button labeled "Test FastAPI Connection". When you click the button, it triggers the `testApi` function. If there's a result (like a message from the API), it will be shown in a paragraph below the button.

- **Script Section**: 
  - It uses the Vue Composition API with `script setup`.
  - A reactive reference, `result`, is initialized to store the API response or an error message.
  - The `testApi` function is defined as asynchronous. When called (by clicking the button), it:
    - Logs a message to the console indicating it's calling the API.
    - Attempts to fetch data from the endpoint `/api/test-fastapi` using `$fetch`.
    - If successful, it updates `result.value` with the message from the API response.
    - If there's an error, it catches it, logs an error message to the console, and updates `result.value` with an error message.

In essence, this code is a basic front-end tool to check if your FastAPI backend is running and responsive by fetching a message from a specific API route.

In a nutshell, this component is all about fetching and displaying the results of an election quiz, showing how parties and votes stack up, and giving users insight into the quiz's data. It's a neat and interactive way to make sense of election data!

## Explanation for `./pages/lovforslag/index.vue`
Alright, let's break down what this Vue component does!

This component is part of a Vue 3 application, using TypeScript, and it's responsible for displaying a list of "lovforslag" (which means "bill proposals" in Danish). Here's a rundown of its main functionalities:

1. **State Management**: 
   - It uses two stores: `mainStore` and `sagStore`. These are likely managing global state related to the application's main functionalities and the specific "sag" (case or bill proposal) data.
   - It uses a composable, `useCurrentPeriode`, to manage periods (likely time periods or sessions for which the proposals are relevant).

2. **Data Fetching**:
   - The component fetches bill proposals from an API endpoint `/api/sag/list`, which are paginated and can be searched.
   - It uses `useFetch` and `useAsyncData` to handle the fetching and reactive updates to the data.

3. **Pagination and Search**:
   - The component has a reactive pagination state, which tracks the current page, page size, and total pages.
   - It includes a search bar to filter the results. The search is debounced, meaning it waits for a pause in typing (300 ms) before triggering a new search to avoid excessive API calls.

4. **Lifecycle and Reactivity**:
   - On component mount (`onMounted`), it initializes by updating the header title, fetching available periods, setting the current period, and refreshing the data.
   - It watches for changes in the search query and the current period, refreshing the data whenever these change.

5. **User Interface**:
   - The template includes a dropdown menu (`USelectMenu`) for selecting a period, a search bar (`SearchBar`), and a list of proposals displayed as cards.
   - Each card shows details of a proposal and includes a link to a detailed view of that proposal.
   - Pagination controls (`PaginationControls`) allow the user to navigate through pages of results.

6. **Styling**:
   - Basic styling is applied to the proposal cards to make them visually distinct.

In summary, this Vue component is a dynamic list interface for browsing and searching through legislative proposals, with support for pagination and period filtering. It efficiently handles user interactions and data fetching in a responsive way!

## Explanation for `./pages/lovforslag/[id].vue`
This Vue component file is designed for a specific page in a Nuxt.js application, possibly displaying details about a legal or legislative proposal, as suggested by the path `./pages/lovforslag/[id].vue`. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Fetching Data**: 
   - It extracts an `id` parameter from the route, which is likely used to identify a specific proposal.
   - It makes an asynchronous fetch request to `/api/sag` with the `id` to retrieve data about a proposal (or "sag" in Danish), which includes details and relations.

2. **Data Handling**:
   - It uses a type guard to ensure that the fetched data is a successful response and then assigns it to a computed property `sag`.
   - It also prepares an error message in case the API response contains an error.

3. **Related Data**:
   - It fetches documents related to the proposal using the `useSagDocuments` function, handling loading and error states.
   - It also fetches actors involved in the proposal using `useAktorer`.

4. **Status Mapping**:
   - Another fetch request gets status data from `/api/sagsstatus` to map status IDs to their corresponding text descriptions. This mapping is used to display human-readable status information in the UI.

5. **Template Rendering**:
   - The template renders a user interface with sections for the proposal's main details, its phases ("sagstrin"), related documents, and involved actors.
   - It handles different states like loading, errors, and no data available.
   - If there are documents, it uses a `PdfViewer` component to show PDFs and a preview of the content.

6. **Additional UI Components**:
   - The template also includes a `PartyStanceVisualization` component, which might visualize stances or opinions related to the proposal, though the specifics of this aren't detailed in the current code.

Overall, this component dynamically fetches and displays detailed information about a specific proposal based on the `id` from the route, presenting it in a structured and user-friendly format.

## Explanation for `./pages/lovforslag/fil/[id].vue`
This Vue component is set up to display content related to a specific "fil" (file) based on an ID taken from the route parameters. Here's a quick breakdown of what it does:

1. **Imports and Setup**: It uses Vue's Composition API, specifically importing `ref` for reactivity, `useRoute` to access the current route (and extract the ID), and `useAsyncData` to handle asynchronous data fetching. It also imports a store called `sagStore`, though it doesn't seem to be used directly in this snippet.

2. **Data Fetching**: The component fetches data asynchronously from an API endpoint that includes the file ID (`/api/sag/files/${id}`). This is done using `useAsyncData`, which provides reactive properties: `content` for the fetched data, `pending` for the loading state, and `error` for any errors that occur during fetching.

3. **Error Handling**: If there's an error during the data fetching, it logs the error to the console.

4. **Template Rendering**: In the template section, it shows a loading message ("Loading ...") while the data is being fetched (`pending` is true). Once the data is loaded (`pending` is false), it displays the content via a component called `FilContent`, passing the fetched data as a prop named `files`.

Overall, this component is a dynamic page that loads and displays specific file data based on the route parameter, handling loading states and potential errors gracefully.

## Explanation for `./pages/ugeplan/index.vue`
Alright, let's break down what's happening in this Vue component:

### Purpose:
This file is a Vue component designed to display a weekly schedule (`ugeplan` means "week plan" in Danish) on a webpage. It allows users to filter meetings based on start date, person, and meeting type.

### Key Features:

1. **Filters Setup:**
   - **Start Date**: Users can select a start date using a date picker. Changing the date triggers an API fetch to update the displayed schedule.
   - **Person Selection**: Users can choose a person from a dropdown menu. The options are fetched from a store that maintains a list of people (`aktørStore`).
   - **Meeting Types**: Users can select one or more meeting types using checkboxes. Each change triggers an update to the displayed schedule.

2. **Data Display:**
   - The component uses a table (`UTable`) to display a list of meetings. Each meeting shows its date, title, start time, location, and agenda items.
   - The date is formatted to a user-friendly Danish locale string.

3. **Data Fetching:**
   - On component mount (`onMounted`), it fetches the list of people and the initial docket (schedule) data using the `fetchPersons` and `fetchDocket` functions.
   - `fetchDocket` sends an API request to gather meetings based on the selected filters (date, person, meeting types) and updates the UI accordingly.

4. **Reactivity and State Management:**
   - Uses Vue's `ref` to create reactive variables for `weeklyDocket`, `meetingTypes`, `startDate`, `selectedPerson`, and `selectedMeetingTypes`.
   - When any filter changes, the `fetchDocket` function is called to update the `weeklyDocket` based on current selections.

5. **Styling:**
   - Utilizes scoped CSS for styling the filter section and meeting entries, ensuring styles are applied only to this component.

In summary, this component is all about providing an interactive interface for users to filter and view a weekly meeting schedule based on specific criteria, fetching data dynamically as the user interacts with the filters.

## Explanation for `./pages/sager/list.vue`
Alright, let's break down what this Vue component is up to! 

This `list.vue` file is a part of a Vue.js application, specifically a page for listing proposals (likely legislative proposals, given the context). Here's a quick overview of what's happening:

1. **Template Section**: The component's template includes three main parts:
   - A `FilterSection` component that lets users filter the proposals by various criteria like period, committee, politician, ministry, date, and search query.
   - A `ProposalList` component that displays the filtered list of proposals.
   - `PaginationControls` to navigate through different pages of proposals.

2. **Script Setup**: The script uses Vue's Composition API (with the `setup` function) and TypeScript for type safety.
   - **Imports**: It imports necessary functions and types, including some custom composables (`useCurrentPeriode`, `useAktorer`) and a store (`useMainStore`).
   - **Refs and State Management**: Uses Vue's `ref` to create reactive variables for managing filter options, search query, and pagination details.
   - **Lifecycle Hooks**: 
     - `onMounted`: When the component is mounted, it fetches available periods and updates the header title to "Sager" (perhaps "Cases" or "Matters" in English). It also fetches the initial list of proposals.
   - **Composable Functions**: It uses composables to fetch and manage data related to periods and actors (committees, politicians, ministries).
   - **Data Fetching**: 
     - `fetchLovforslag` is an async function that fetches proposals based on the current filter selections and pagination state, then updates the proposals list and pagination info.
   - **Reactivity**:
     - The `watch` function observes changes in the filter options and triggers a refresh of the proposals list whenever any filter changes.
   - **Pagination**: The `changePage` function updates the current page and fetches proposals for that page.

Overall, this component is part of a dynamic, interactive page where users can filter and browse through a list of proposals based on various criteria. It's like a custom search engine for legislative proposals!

## Explanation for `./server/api/meeting/index.ts`
To give you a concise explanation, I'd need to see the content of the `index.ts` file you're referring to. However, I can give you a general idea of what a file like `index.ts` under a path like `./server/api/meeting/` typically does in a Node.js or Express.js application.

1. **RESTful API Endpoints**: This file likely defines the API endpoints related to "meetings." It could include routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting meetings (often referred to as CRUD operations).

2. **Route Handling**: It might import and use a router object from Express.js. Routes could be set up to handle HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

3. **Middleware**: The file might use middleware for tasks such as authentication, validation, or logging before requests reach the business logic.

4. **Controllers**: It may import controllers which contain the actual logic for handling requests and generating responses.

5. **Exporting the Router**: At the end, it likely exports the configured router so it can be integrated into the larger application.

If you can share the actual code, I can give you a more precise breakdown of what it does!

## Explanation for `./pages/cases/list.vue`
This Vue component is essentially a page that lists proposals (or "lovforslag" in Danish), allowing users to filter and paginate through them. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Template Section**: 
   - It uses a `<FilterSection>` component to allow users to filter proposals based on several criteria like period, committee, politician, ministry, date, and a search query.
   - A `<ProposalList>` component is used to display the filtered list of proposals.
   - `<PaginationControls>` are provided to navigate through different pages of proposals.

2. **Script Section**:
   - **Imports and Setup**: The script uses Vue's Composition API, importing necessary functions and types. It sets up reactive references for various filters, the list of proposals, and pagination details.
   - **Composables**: 
     - `useCurrentPeriode` is used to fetch and manage the current period and its related data.
     - `useAktorer` is used to fetch data about committees, politicians, and ministries.
   - **Data Fetching**:
     - The `fetchLovforslag` function fetches proposals from an API endpoint (`/api/sag/list`) with parameters based on the current filters and pagination settings.
     - This function is called initially when the component is mounted and whenever the filter criteria change, using `watchEffect`.
   - **Pagination**:
     - The `changePage` function updates the current page and triggers data fetching for the new page.

In summary, this file creates an interactive list view for legislative proposals where users can apply filters and navigate through pages of results, with data dynamically fetched based on the current state of filters and pagination.

## Explanation for `./pages/meeting/[id].vue`
Alright, let's break it down! This code is for a Vue.js component, specifically a page that likely displays information about a meeting. Here's a quick rundown of what's going on:

1. **Template Section**: 
   - The `<template>` section contains the HTML structure of the page. It currently has a heading (`<h1>`) with the text "Møde", which is Danish for "Meeting". This is where you'd put more HTML to display detailed meeting info or any other relevant content.

2. **Script Section**:
   - The `<script setup lang="ts">` indicates that this script is written using the Composition API with TypeScript. 
   - It imports a `useMainStore` function, which is probably a part of Vuex or Pinia (a state management library for Vue).
   - `mainStore` is initialized by calling `useMainStore()`, giving you access to the shared state or actions defined in the `main` store.
   - The line `mainStore.updateHeaderTitle('Møde')` sets the header title of the application to "Møde" using a method from the store. This implies the app might have a dynamic header that changes based on the current page or context.

3. **Style Section**:
   - The `<style scoped>` block is where you'd write CSS that's only applied to this component, keeping styles from leaking out or getting affected by other styles. It's currently empty.

In summary, this Vue component is a simple setup for a meeting page with a title and a placeholder for content. It also updates the header title using a state management library.

## Explanation for `./pages/agenda/index.vue`

   - **Start Date**: Using a date input.
   - **Person**: From a dropdown menu populated with options fetched from an API.
   - **Meeting Types**: Using checkboxes for each type of meeting.

2. **Data Fetching**:
   - **`fetchDocket()`**: This function is called whenever filters change. It fetches data from an API endpoint (`/api/ugeplan`) with parameters for date, person, meeting types, and current period ID. The response updates:
     - `weeklyDocket`: List of meetings for the week.
     - `aktører`: List of persons stored in a Vuex-like store.
     - `meetingTypes`: Types of meetings available.
   - **`fetchPersons()`**: Fetches a list of persons from another API endpoint (`/api/actors`) and updates the store.

3. **Table Display**:
   - Displays the fetched meetings in a table (`UTable` component).
   - Custom templates for displaying the date in a formatted manner and listing agenda items under each meeting.

4. **Lifecycle**:
   - On component mount (`onMounted`), it fetches the list of persons and initial docket data to ensure the component starts with up-to-date information.

5. **Styling**:
   - Some basic CSS is used to style the layout of filters and meetings for a clean user interface.

### Tech Details:

- **Vue and TypeScript**: The component uses Vue's `<script setup>` with TypeScript for defining reactive data and functions.
- **Reactivity**: Utilizes `ref` for reactive data binding, ensuring UI updates with data changes.
